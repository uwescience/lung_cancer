TCGA-78-8648,"HISTORY. Histopathology of right upper lobe and chest wall resection for cancer. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper. lobe with attached chest wall. The right upper lobe measures 140 x 100 x 79 mm. in maximum dimension. The chest wall component consists of four ribs and. measures 140 X 60 mm in maximum dimension. On the hilar surface there are two. vertical soft tissue excision margins which are closed with staples, the. longest of which measures 90 mm and the other measures 60 mm. The staples are. removed and the new resection margin is inked in blue. On sectioning the. specimen there is a large cavitating mass which has an ill-defined lobulated. appearance and measures, in maximum dimension, 58 X 55 mm. The tumour appears. to lie approximately 13 mm from the bronchial resection margin. The tumour. lies well clear of the longest soft tissue excision margin and approximately 8. mm from the shorter soft tissue excision margin. The chest wall is blunt. A. dissected off the main specimen. The tumour does not appear macroscopically to. have infiltrated the chest wall as there is a thickened greyish-white soft. N. fibrous-like capsule between the tumour and the chest wall. The tumour focally. A. appears to be very close to the serosal surface. The small amount of normal. lung parenchyma that is present appears unremarkable. [1A, bronchial resection.

Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled left upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy. specimen measuring in its partially inflated state 210 x 150 x 50 mm. Two. separate bronchi are seen at the hilum ranging in size from 10 to 12 mm in. diameter (lying approximately 30 mm apart). Surrounding the two bronchi is a. bare area measuring 55 mm in maximal diameter. A staple line is seen radiating. from the hilar to the periphery, it measures 80 mm in length. Differential. inking is as follows, the bare area is inked black and the staple line is. removed and inked blue. The pleural surface is tan to grey with a diffuse area. of induration over the lateral lower aspect of the lobe extending over the. lingular, which measures 60 mm in greatest dimension. There is also scarring. over the apex measuring 15 mm in greatest dimension. The cut surface of the. lung shows a centrally based/peri-bronchial tumour measuring 35 mm in greatest. dimension. It extends peripherally to focally abut the pleural surface. (posterior lateral). Definite macroscopic invasion of the pleura is not seen. The tumour has a white firm cut surface with focal areas of necrosis. It lles. 10 mm from the closest bronchial margin. A second firm tan nodule measuring 6. mm in greatest dimension in the apical portion of the lobe. It lies 2 mm from. the pleural surface (appears to abut the pleural surface) and over 70 mm to the. bronchial margin and 65 mm from the main tumour mass. There is normal. intervening lung.

Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right lower lobe"" and consists of a lobectomy specimen which measures. 135 mm from superior to inferior, 150 mm at the base from anterior to posterior and up to 55 mm from. lateral to medial. The pleural surface is smooth. There is a stapled resection margin superior to the. hilum. A firm nodule is palpable inferior to the hilum. Adjacent to the bronchial resection margin. there is a firm nodule which is relatively circumscribed. It measures approximately 18 mm in diameter. and on sectioning appears to represent an involved lymph node with an adjacent compressed bronchial. branch. Sectioning of the lung parenchyma reveals a large tumour mass which extends from the hilum. towards the periphery. The nodule is irregular in shape. It has a cream and grey cut surface. It. measures 55 x 50 X 35 mm and lies approximately 15 mm from the overlying diaphragmatic pleural. surface, but extends to within 3mm of the lateral pleura. Towards the hilum there is a second. circumscribed nodule which lies immediately adjacent to the main tumour mass.

COMMENT: Because this carcinoma expresses CDX2 in the absence of TTF1, it is essential that an extrathoracic primary site of. origin, particularly in the GI tract be excluded be fore accepting this case as a primary lung adenocarcinoma. The. synoptic indicated below reflects an assumption that all other potential primary sites have been excluded. Approximately. 3-10% of lung carcinomas can be CDX2 positive, usually mucinous ones as is this case. CK7 is positive while stains for thyroglobulin and CK20 are negative.

COMMENT. Sections show a poorly differentiated central tumor with focal evidence. of squamous differentiation. The tumor focally invades small venous. vessels. By immunohistochemistry the tumor stains positive for high. molecular weight keratin, CK5/6, and p63, focally positive for CD56, and. negative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, chromogranin, and synaptophysin,. consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. Selected slides from the. patient' S previous resection. were reviewed for comparison,. and show a squamous cell carcinoma with extensive keratinization that. appears morphologically different from the present tumor. While a. dedifferentiated metastasis cannot be definitively excluded, the present. lung tumor is therefore favored to represent a second primary squamous. cell carcinoma, stage pT2N1.

KRAS Exon 1 mutation IS IDENTIFIED (Gly12Cys). B. EGFR Exon 19 mutation NOT identified. C. EGFR Exon 21 mutation NOT identified. Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian. population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Sample Preparation and Gene Sequencing Analysis. For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, tumor microdissection was. performed. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of mutation, DNA. was amplified with primers flanking exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. Then, forward and reverse sequencing. was. performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on AB/3130 (Applied Biosystems). The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations. with Mutation Surveyor V3.01 (SoftGenetics). Addendum. TM. PROBE: Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/ CEP 7 SpectrumGreen Probe. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 1.2 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 26% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CASE SYNOPSIS: SYNOPTIC DATA - PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS. TUMOR LOCATION: Right Lower Lobe. PROCEDURE: Lobectomy. TUMOR SIZE: Maximum dimension: 6.0 cm.

Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a lobectomy specimen measuring 170 x 70 mm with a depth of up to 80 mm. Some puckering is present over the lateral pleural surface. The tumour measures 75 x 55 x 75 mm and. abuts, does not clearly penetrate, the pleural surface. The tumour appears at least 20 mm clear of the. hilar resection margin. There is no obvious endophytic bronchial component to the tumour, although it. clearly is associated with bronchial structures. A separate small pleural nodule is identified, 45 mm. from the nearest tumour. [Bronchial resection margin, 1A; vascular resection margin, 1B; hilar lymph. nodes, 1C-1G; block 1E includes inked resection margin; pleural surface with tumour, 1H-1I; tumour. towards hilar aspect, 1J-1L; separate pleural nodule, 1M; macroscopically unremarkable lung, 1N]. Microscopy: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extensive central necrosis and. cavitation. A definite bronchial origin is not identified. There is no evidence of pleural invasion, and. the separate pleural nodule is shown to represent a silicotic nodule within a pleural lymph node. No. lymphatic invasion is seen, however metastatic carcinoma is present in one of the peribronchial lymph. nodes. Vascular invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy but. shows a benign mucous gland adenoma. Lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumour shows organising. pneumonia while distant lung parenchyma shows emphysema. 2: HILAR LYMPH NODE. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a piece of dark brown tissue, 4 x 4 x 3 mm. [BIT, 2A]. Microscopy: Sections show fragments of lymph nodes containing large numbers of pigmented macrophages but. showing no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 3: PARTIAL BRONCHUS RIGHT SIDE. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a portion of bronchial wall measuring 25 x 15 x 5 mm. No obvious mucosal. abnormality is identified. [Serially sectioned and all pieces blocked, 3A]. Microscopy: Sections show full thickness bronchial wall in which there is no evidence of the mucous gland. adenoma seen in the resection margin of specimen 1. However there is squamous metaplasia with. severe dysplasia which falls short of carcinoma in situ. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.

TCGA-78-7156,"HISTORY. ? Bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. MACROSCOPIC. Five specimens received: 1: The first specimen which is a frozen section is labelled ""Lung Bx, frozen section' and consists of a. wedge of lung tissue with overlying visceral pleura measuring 20 X 12 x 4 mm. Serial sections taken. through specimen. No discrete lesion identified. [BIT for FS.]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma (abuts diathermy margin). Result phoned to. [Frozen section remnants, 1A.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled with the patient's details only and consists of a left. pneumonectomy specimen. The left upper lobe measures 250 (SI) X 150 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). The left. lower lobe measures 230 (SI) x 140 (AP) x 70 mm (ML). There is an incomplete fissure on the lateral. surface of the left lower lobe. Over the lateral aspect of the pleura of the left upper lobe there is a. broad area of pallor under which the lung parenchyma is firm. This area measures approximately 140. X 110 mm. Similar subpleural firm pale areas are present throughout the lingula and are present on. both. the lateral and medial aspects of the pleura and varying in size from 3 mm up to 30 mm. At the. hilar aspect of the lung the bronchial resection margin measures 20 mm in diameter and is raised 30. mm from the surrounding tissue. A single area of pale subpleural thickening is noted in the left lower. lobe measuring 11 mm in maximum dimension. This area occurs on the anterior aspect of the left. lower lobe in the interlobar fissure. There are three areas of pleural deficiency on the left upper lobe;. one anterior and lateral measuring 30 mm in diameter and one overlying the pale area posteriorly and. superiorly measuring 30 mm in diameter where the pleura appears pulled back and is able to be laid. over the deficit. A third sutured area of pleural deficit and an underlying parenchymal defect is noted. at the postero-inferior edge of the left upper lobe laterally. This area measures 30 mm in diameter. On sectioning the lung, the majority of the left upper lobe is replaced by confluent pale tumour. measuring 165 (SI) X 120 (AP) x up to 60 mm (ML). There are numerous other deposits in the lingula. and in the most inferior aspect of the left upper lobe varying in size from 1 mm up to 20 mm. There is. extensive subpleural tumour with the large majority of the lateral aspect of the pleura appearing to be. involved by tumour. Further sectioning reveals tumour to abut the pleura on the medial aspect of the. left upper lobe adjacent to the hilum. Tumour approaches but does not appear to reach the hilar. resection margin. There is no definite tumour on the visceral pleural surface. Sectioning the left lower lobe also reveals multiple deposits of pale tumour both in superior and. inferior aspects of the lobe. These tumour deposits vary in size from 5 up to 30 mm in maximum. extent. [Bronchial resection margin, 2A; hilar lymph nodes, 2B; vascular resection margins, 2C; hilar and. peribronchial lymph nodes, 2D-2E; tumour underlying pleura and adjacent inked hilar resection. margin, 2F; tumour underlying pleura of left upper lobe adjacent to hilar resection margin, 2G; solid. area of tumour medial left upper lobe no pleura, 2H; inferior left upper lobe tumour and overlying. pleura, 2I; superior, 2J; lateral area of inferior left upper lobe in region of sutured pleural defect (?.

X. 20 X 15 mm in maximum extent. wo bisected, 3A; third bisected, 3B.]. 4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""mediastinal lymph node' and consists of five fragments of lymph. node varying in size from 5 up to 12 mm in maximum extent and one piece of fat measuring 5 mm. [Lymph nodes bisected in toto, 4A.]. 5: The fifth specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node' and consists of a single lymph node measuring 12. mm in maximum extent. [Bisected in toto, 5A.]. MIICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Lepidic extension of. tumour is also noted. The overlying visceral pleura is not infiltrated by tumour, Tumour involves the. diathermied margin. 2: Within the upper and lower lobes there are multiple deposits of well differentiated adenocarcinoma. which in areas show relatively extensive lepidic extension. The invasive tumour shows a predominant. papillary architecture and is composed of mucinous and non-mucinous cells. Tumour deposits abut the. visceral pleura in number of areas and there is focal visceral pleural invasion. No pleural surface. involvement is seen. There is distension of some lymphatic channels. No unequivocal lymphatic. invasion is seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation is identified. The bronchial resection. margin is clear of tumour. Tumour approaches to within 30um of the peri-hilar margin in an area. devoid of pleura. Although this margin is closely approached, tumour is not transected in this region. Tumour abuts the area of diathermy artefact within the upper lobe corresponding to the biopsy site for. frozen section. In a separate area, tumour abuts visceral pleura which shows diathermy artefact. precluding further assessment. Tumour infiltrates one of the lymph nodes within the hilar region. direct extension. The remaining lymph nodes are not involved. Lung parenchyma away from the. tumours shows emphysema together with foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. 3-5: The lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and. mild follicular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Left lung and lymph nodes (hilar and mediastinal): Well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Multiple separate lesions involving the upper and lower lobes. Largest tumour deposit 165 mm in diameter. Visceral pleura focally involved, no surface involvement identified. No unequivocal lymphatic invasion seen. No vascular invasion or perineural permeation identified. Bronchial resection margin clear, peri-hilar margin closely approached. Perihilar lymph node involved by direct extension of tumour. Remaining hilar lymph nodes and mediastinal nodes not involved by tumour. Non-neoplastic lung: Emphysema and foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Pathological stage: T4 N1 M1.

Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement. labelled ""left lung"" is an intact lung with two lobes. weighing 442 grams. There is a suture line present at the. amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary. artery and main left pulmonary vein. The pleural surface of the. lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present. No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are. evident. Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are. present adjacent to the bronchial stump. There is a mass that is. palpable in the interlobar fissure. This appears to be below the. surface of the lung. Sections are placed through the mass and this. reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main. bronchus. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 X 5 X 4 cm. It. arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that. grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor. There does appear. to be at least one lymph node which is partially involved by tumor. adjacent the bronchus. Portions of the t. ormal lung are. submitted for procurement per request of. Further. sectioning of the lung reveals a second t present deep to. the pleural surface of the lower lobe. This pleural mass as central. necrosis and measures maximally 3 X 2 X 1.5 cm. It has the same. fleshy tan-white gritty cut surface as does the main tumor mass. The upper lobe does not appear to have any discrete nodules. It. is. crepitant gray-tan tissue without focal nodularity. Sections after. fixation. BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - bronchial margin; 2 - vascular margin; 3 -. pleural margin of the main dominant tumor mass; 4-7 - dominant tumor. mass; 8-10 - secondary smaller tumor including pleural surface; 11. random left upper lobe; 12 - random left lower lobe; 13-14 -. bronchial lymph nodes. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. Microscopic sections of both lesions present in the left. lung have a similar histologic appearance. Both are. moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with cells. exhibiting prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm. It is not clear from. the histology if this represents two separate primary tumors or an. intrapulmonary metastasis from the main lung tumor. Results of. the. evaluation of the lung are summarized in the following template: Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma. Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated.

Three specimens received: 1: The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and is labelled 'arterial margin' and consists of a. piece of muscular artery wall measuring 15 X 4 X 1 mm. No abnormalities are apparent. [BIT for. frozen section, 1A]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS. No evidence of malignancy. Result phoned to. on the. 2: The specimen is labelled 'right lung lower and middle' and consists of the right middle and lower. lobes as stated. The lower lobe measures 155 x 100 x 40 mm and the middle lobe 135 x 90 x 30 mm. There is a stapled resection margin along the middle lobe, 150 mm in length. A rounded endobronchial. tumour plug extends to the bronchial resection margin, however there is no attachment to the bronchial. wall in this region. The pleural surface appears indurated and tethered on the anterior apical part of the. lower lobe over an area approximately 25 x 30 mm. Sectioning reveals a tumour within the apical. segment of the lower lobe measuring 50 x 45 x 45mm with endobronchial extension up to a distance of. 40mm. The entire lesion measuring approximately 75mm in maximal dimension. The endobronchial. plug of tumour extends to involve the proximal portion of the middle lobe bronchus and is focally. tethered to the wall at this point. The alveolated parenchyma of the middle lobe appears clear of. tumour and no tumour is present at the stapled resection margin. The endobronchial plug of tumour. also extends up the bronchus to the bronchial resection margin. However, as mentioned previously the. tumour is not attached to the bronchial wall in this region. A peribronchial lymph node appears to be. involved by tumour, possibly by direct extension. The bronchial and peribronchial resection margins. appear macroscopically clear of the tumour. Localised bronchiectasis is present distal to the. endobronchial tumour plug. [2A, 5 hilar lymph nodes; 2B, bronchial resection margin en face; 2C-D,.

Within both pieces of tissue there appears to be a lymph node, 24 mm and 34. mm in maximum extent. [3A-B, first lymph node bisected; 3C-D, second lymph node bisected]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of an elastic walled artery with no evidence of. tumour. 2: Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma involving the apical segment of the. right lower lobe with extensive endobronchial extension. The tumour does not invade the visceral. pleura. The bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour. Tumour extends into peribronchial. connective tissue adjacent to the resection margin but is 0.3mm clear of the peribronchial resection. margin. Within peribronchial connective tissue in this region perineural permeation by tumour is. identified. The involved nerve measures 350um in diameter and in the section examined is 1.3mm. clear of the peribronchial resection margin. Lymphatic invasion is identified. Some small blood. vessels show evidence of recanalisation, however no unequivocal vascular invasion is seen. A. peribronchial lymph node is involved by tumour, possibly by direct extension. Peribronchial lymph. nodes also show evidence of sinus histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered. flecks of birefringent material consistent with silicate. Within adjacent lung parenchyma there is. bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging and focal endogenous lipoid pneumonia consistent with. obstructive pneumonitis. The section of right middle lobe alveolated lung parenchyma shows. bronchiectasis with mucoid plugging, however no tumour is identified. Rare mixed duct macules are. present within the remaining alveolated lung parenchyma which is otherwise unremarkable. 3: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, follicular hyperplasia,. carbon pigment deposition, fibrosis and scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent with silicate. No tumour is identified.

Remaining fragments sectioned into 4RS. and blocked, 2B.]. 3: The third specimen is labelled ""right lower lobe"" and consists of a right. lower lobe of lung measuring 115 X 90 x 80 mm. The pleural surface appears. largely puckered, extending from the diaphragmatic surface of the lung and from. the posterior to anterior pleural surfaces. A large firm mass is palpable. beneath the area of pleural puckering. On sectioning, a large tumour mass is. confirmed, measuring 60 x 48 x 70 mm. The tumour has a cream to yellow cut. surface with areas of grey to black mottling. The tumour appears to approach. both the posterior and anterior and diaphragmatic surfaces. The tumour is. approximately 6 mm away from the medial pleural margin. On opening of the. bronchial tree, the tumour appears to arise from a bronchial branch. approximately 10 mm away from the bronchial resection margin. A large vessel. runs through the middle of the tumour. However it does not appear. macroscopically invaded. The uninvolved lung parenchyma appears unremarkable.

Microscopy: Sections show a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with a prominent mucinous bronchiolo-alveolar. carcinoma component. Focally the tumour appears to be invasive. It closely abuts the pleural surface. Overlying this there is a thick organising fibrinous pleurisy. Although definite invasion of the pleura is. not seen, there are suspicious features and special stains will be performed. No vascular or perineural. invasion is seen. Small satellite deposits of tumour are scattered throughout the adjacent parenchyma. These are also identified in the parenchyma of the section taken of the bronchus immediately adjacent. to the bronchial resection margin (Block F). Both the bronchial resection margin and the bronchus. within the immediately adjacent section show no evidence of malignancy. No metastases to hilar. lymph nodes are seen. The lung tissue away from the mass in block H shows no specific abnormality. 2: HILAR LYMPH NODE. Macroscopy: Specimen consists of a single piece of grey firm tissue which measures 12 X 5 X 5 mm.

Received fresh in a container labeled ""right upper. lobe"" is a 296 gm, 17.8 x 11.8 x 4 cm, lung lobe compatible. with right upper lobe. In the hilar region there is an 0.8 cm long. and 1.5 cm in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly. unremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly. unremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 cm in. greatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is. pink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There is some. retraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and. there is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 Cm rubbery tan-white mass underlying the. area with pleural retraction, with the mass suggestive of invading. the pleura. Approximately 2 cm from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5. x 3. Cm rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near. to the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange. discoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without. additional lesions.

The following template summarizes the findings in this. case: Histologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly. differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is. favored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent. foci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). Although not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) These two lesions are grossly 2.6 cm and 4 cm. in greatest dimension. The 2.6 cm in diameter lesion has visceral. pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very. peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish between. synchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same. process, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new. guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. would be classified as pT3. Clinical correlation is recommended. Margins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins. are negative. Direct extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2. 6. cm in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger. lesion. Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : pNl. There is metastatic carcínoma in. one of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted. lymph nodes in parts B, C, D, and E are negative for malignancy.

EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma. Kinase). gene rearrangements in adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to TKIs and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the ALK. inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene rearrangement by FISH is available as the. Lung. Cancer. Mutation Panel.

CD56. marks about 5-10% of the tumor cell cytoplasm and cytokeratin 5/6 marks approximately 20-30% of the tumor cells. Cytokeratin 7 and thyroid. transcription. factor-1 (TTF-1) are negative. These stains support a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma. The mildly positive CD56. indicates a small component of a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The positive control slides for CK7. TTF-1, CD56, p63, and SK are appropriate. The. positive control for CK5/6 is assigned to case. CLINICAL INFORMATION. CLINICAL HISTORY: Preoperative Diagnosis: Right lower lobe lung cancer.

TCGA-78-7153,"HISTORY. Large right upper lobe tumour. MACROSCOPIC. Six specimens received: 1: The specimen is labelled ""middle and upper right lobe"" and comprises right upper and middle lobe,. received fresh, and measuring 160 X 60 X 60 mm. There is a marked degree of pleural puckering and. indrawing over the postero-lateral surface of the upper lobe. The pleura overlying the middle lobe. appears normal. A stapled margin, 65 mm in length, is present above the hilum. The bronchial. resection margins and vascular resection margins show no evidence of tumour. Peribronchial lymph. nodes are black and soft. Transverse slicing reveals a somewhat ill-defined tumour mass, 47 mm. in. diameter, within the postero-lateral aspect of the upper lobe extending almost to the pleural surface and. extending to within 10 mm of the bronchial resection margin. The surrounding lung parenchyma. appears consolidated and yellowish in colour. The main tumour mass is pale grey to cream in colour. with focal carbon pigmentation. The remainder of the lung parenchyma shows no pathological. features. Towards the apex of the upper lobe there is a second contiguous lobulated tumour mass, 30. mm in diameter, which also appears clear of the pleura. This has a more tan cut surface.

Six specimens are received. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""R middle lobe, R lower lobe, R upper lobe"". and consists of right middle and lower lobes with a small stapled wedge of. upper lobe superiorly. The specimen measures 165 x 75 x 45 mm with the stapled. wedge of upper lobe measuring 70 x 30 x 30 mm. There is a firm mass with. overlying pleural adhesions at the apical aspect of the lower lobe, measuring. 52 x 50 x 35 mm. On sectioning, the mass has a pale sclerotic appearance and. is centrally cavitated. The cavity measures 12 mm across. The tumour extends. to apparently involve the lateral pleural surface and it extends close to the. pleura on the medial aspect. In this region it extends into a bronchus. There. is possible involvement of the upper lobe but the tumour appears well clear of. the stapled upper lobe resection margin. No other focal lesions are identified. on sectioning and there are no other endobronchial lesions. [Bronchial and. vascular resection margin, 1A; peribronchial lymph nodes, 1B; tumour with. overlying pleura, 1C-1E; tumour and upper lobe resection margin, 1F; tumour and. medial surface of lung, 1G; further section, 1H; tumour and proximal bronchus,. 1I; random section of lung, 1J.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled ""upper lobe lymph node"" and consists of two. pieces of lymph node, 17 x 15 x 7 mm and 15 x 11 x 8 mm.

[Bisected and BIT]. 6: The sixth specimen is labelled ""No. 9 lymph node"" and consists of lymph node. with surrounding fat measuring 35 x 16 x 8 mm. [Bisected and BIT]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with central. cavitation. The cavitation appears to be due, at least in part, to vascular. invasion by tumour which is present at multiple sites throughout the sections. Tumour invades into overlying parietal pleura but appears clear of the soft. tissue resection margin. No lymphatic invasion is seen, and peribronchial. lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The upper lobe resection. margin is well clear of malignancy. Proximally the tumour has a protruding. endobronchial component but no in situ squamous carcinoma Is found, and the. bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy. Focal perineural invasion. is found towards the hilum. Lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumour shows. organising pneumonia, while more distant lung parenchyma is unremarkable. 2: Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and several silicotic nodules,. but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 3: Sections show small foci of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in one of. the lymph nodes. 4-6: Sections show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and scattered silicotic. nodules, but there is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of an upper lobe measuring 150 x 85 x 50. mm in the fresh state. 15 mm lateral to the bronchial resection margin and hilum, there is a nodular,. firm subpleural mass measuring 20 mm in diameter. On sectioning, the mass is pale, fleshy and. measures 27 mm in diameter. It underlies a proximal bronchus but is well clear of the bronchial. resection margins. [Sections taken; bronchial resection margin and hilar and peribronchial lymph. nodes, 1A; tumour with overlying pleura, 1B-1D; section of uninvolved lung, 1E]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of two pieces of blackened lymph node,. each measuring 14 and 8 mm in maximal dimensions. The largest piece is bisected. [Wrapped and. blocked in toto, 2A]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour shows areas of clear. cell change. The lesion is subpleural but definite pleural invasion is not identified. Special stains will. be performed to assess this. The tumour is also in the region of a bronchus. In this area there appears. to be an in situ component. There is focal blood vessel invasion but no lymphatic permeation is seen. Perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin. No. lymph node metastases are seen. The adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. 2: A deposit of poorly differentiated carcinoma is present within the lymph node cortex. SUMMARY. Right upper lobe and hilar lymph nodes: 1: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 27 mm in maximal dimension. 2: Blood vessel and perineural invasion present but no lymphatic permeation seen. 3: No definite pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin. 4: Hilar lymph node metastases. 5: T1N1MX. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. Focal neuroendocrine positivity is identified within the tumour with chromogranin, synaptophysin and. CD 56. The positive areas appear to be in the better differentiated squamous areas. Therefore the. tumour is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showing focal neuroendocrine. differentiation.

There are features suspicious for pleural invasion within this area and special stains will be performed. to assess this. The tumour is not present on the pleural surface. No blood vessel, lymphatic or. perineural invasion is seen. The tumour appears to directly invade a peribronchial lymph node. The. adjacent lung shows no significant changes. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 4: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 6: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. 7: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes and a small silicotic nodule. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 8: Sections show squamous cell carcinoma, which is surrounded by a dense fibrous capsule. Some. lymphoid aggregates present in this region and it is presumed that this deposit of squamous cell. carcinoma is present within a lymph node. An adjacent smaller lymph node is present and this shows. reactive changes only. No bronchial wall is present for assessment. Tumour extends extremely closely. to the diathermied resection margin. 9: Sections of the bronchus show a small amount of residual squamous cell carcinoma in situ. No. invasive carcinoma is seen. SUMMARY. Right upper lobe and hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes: 1: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 28 mm in maximal dimension. 2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present. 3: Probable pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed. 4: Squamous cell carcinoma in situ extends to bronchial margin but invasive component clear. 5: No lymph node metastases. 6: T2N1MX.

Page: 2 of 6. COMMENT. This case was initially signed out as a provisional report on. and has been amended to include results of immunohistochemical. stains. The diagnoses have not changed from the original report. The lymph nodes resected in the case (specimen 1-8) show diffuse. involvement with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Occasional mixed dust nodules with central hyalinization and focal. central necrosis are also present. Special stains for fungal elements. and acid-fast organisms are negative. There is no evidence of metastatic. carcinoma in any of the lymph nodes examined. :ctions of the tumor in specimen 8 show predominately moderately. differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (90%) with a small component. (10%) of a poorly differentiated spindle cell carcinoma that demonstrates. shows multiple mitoses and severe cytologic atypia. There is no. malignant cartilage, bone, or skeletal muscle identified in the spindle. cell component. Immunohistochemistry shows the squamous cell component. of the tumor to be positive for multiple cytokeratins (HMWK, CK5/6,. E1/AE3) and p63. The spindled component shows weak positive staining. for CK5/6 and p63, with very focal positive staining for CK7. The EGFR. shows strong membranous staining in approximately 90% of both the. moderately differentiated. component and the spindled component. Both. components are negative for p53 and TTF-1. The findings are consistent. with a pleomorphic carcinoma composed of predominantly squamous cell. carcinoma (moderately differentiated, 90%) and pleomorphic spindle-cell. carcinoma (poorly differentiated, 10%), pT2NO. The residual lung parenchyma in both specimen 1 (""wedge resection right. middle lobe"") and specimen 8 (""right lower lobe"") shows patchy. interstitial fibrosis that appears accentuated in a subpleural. distribution, with focal areas of architectural remodeling and cyst. formation (microscopic honeycomb change) There is mild chronic. interstitial inflammation associated with areas of fibrosis. Fibroblastic. foci are readily identified. The blood vessels show focal fibrointimal. thickening, likely secondary to the background inflammatory process, but. no diagnostic evidence of active vasculitis. Granulomas are noted within. an intraparenchymal lymph node (specimen 1), but are not identified in. the lung parenchyma itself. .ne overall findings in the lung tissue are in keeping with pulmonary. Page: 3 of 6. fibrosis of UIP pattern. However, the simultaneous presence of numerous. non-necrotizing granulomas within the lymph nodes is not typical of UIP,. and may indicate a second superimposed process, the differential. diagnosis of which is broad but which could include infections, drug. reactions, and sarcoidosis.

TCGA-55-7914,"ADDENDUM REPORT. LUNG CANCER MUTATION PANEL. SPECIMEN SOURCE: LUNG WEDGE. SPECIMEN/BLOCK NUMBER: EGFR Mutation: NOT DETECTED. Results reviewed by. Sequencing of the entire coding region and splice junction sites of exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene revealed no previously published mutations or any. sequence. changes that could result in amino acid changes. As 7% of patients who respond to EGFR inhibitors do not show mutations in exons 18-21 of. EGFR gene, a negative result does not preclude the possibility of a clinical response to EGFR inhibitors. KRAS Mutation Analysis. KRAS Mutation: DETECTED. (Abnormal) This result was reviewed and interpreted b. Based on sequence analysis, K-Ras codon 12 GGT>TGT (G12C) mutant was detected. FISH, ALK, 2p23. FISH, ALK, 2P23: SEE BELOW. Specimen Type: Paraffin Embedded Tumor Tissue. Clinical Indication: FISH study for ALK. Method FISH. Total Cells : 100. Images Captured : 2. nuc ish(ALKx3-10)[79/100]. INTERPRETATION : FISH RESULT NEGATIVE FOR REARRANGEMENT OF ALK GENE, SUGGESTIVE OF GAIN OF ALK REGION. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, using break-apart probes specific for ALK gene (2p23; Abbott Molecular), did not exhibit a break-apart. pattern. Thus, this result is not indicative of a translocation involving the ALK gene. As. an incidental finding, additional 1-8 copies of the ALK region were observed in 79% of cells. This suggests gain of the ALK region. The clinical. significance of this incidental finding is unknown. A small proportion of tumors (approximately 5%) with ALK rearrangement demonstrated by other methods may be missed by this study. This result does not rule out a malignancy or other genetic changes. This result should be considered in combination with other clinical and/or laboratory. data. The cutoff values for ALK rearrangement are 12% for paraffin-embedded specimens, 3% for bone marrow, 5% for peripheral blood. Please expect. the result of any other concurrent test in a separate report. This test was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by. has. not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA nas determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. Laboratory results reviewed and Clinical Interpretation provided by. Test performed and reported under supervision of. Mutational analysis of the EGFR and KRAS genes and ALK locus rearrangement by FISH were performed to survey the most common tumor-associated. genetic changes that have been shown to have prognostic and therapeutic consequences in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR kinase domain mutations are found in 10-15% of lung adenocarcinomas, particularly those occurring in younger patients without a smoking. history,. and. identify. tumors. that may have significant clinical response to EGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors. Secondary somatic mutations in EGFR, particularly. T790M in exon 20, may accompany acquired resistance to these inhibitors. KRAS point mutations occur in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinomas and are largely mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations. KRAS mutations are. associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to anti-EGFR-directed immunotherapy. ALK. locus rearrangement resulting in the EML4-ALK gene fusion is present in 3-5% of NSCLC, is most commonly seen in adenocarcinomas from. younger patients, and produces overexpression of the ALK tyrosine kinase. Patients who harbor ALK rearrangement do not benefit from EGFR tyrosine. kinase inhibitors and are recommended to be directed to trials of ALK-targeted agents. The. exons tested cumulatively comprise greater than 95% of the known activating mutations in the selected genes; rare mutations occurring at other sites. or in other genes that may influence outcome cannot be excluded. Genomic DNA was extracted from microdissected paraffin-embedded tissue sections isolated from the submitted block. PCR-based DNA sequencing. was. used to assess for mutations in exon 1 (including codon 12 & 13) and exon 2 (including codon 61) of KRAS and exons 18-21 of the EGFR. tyrosine. kinase. (TK) domain. The sensitivity for mutation detection for these assays is approximately 10% mutant allele in the background of normal. allele. in. the. microdissected area. The KRAS and EGFR test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. The FISH test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by. It. has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

COMMENTS: Appropriately controlled immunohistochemical stains for pancytokeratin performed on block C2 shows numerous positive tumor cells in lymph nodes. Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to help select patients for. Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma. Kinase) gene rearrangements in adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to TKIs and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the ALK. inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene rearrangement by FISH is available as the. Lung. Cancer. Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are available on request as a panel or as individual assays.

It consists of one grossly identifiable fragment. of fleshy hemorrhagic tissue consistent with lung. A long black. suture which does not designate anything in particular is attached to. the specimen. The specimen weighs 66 grams and measures 10 x 6.5 x 4. cm. A palpable mass is identified in the parenchyma. The overlying. pleura is inked with black ink. Serially sectioning the lung reveals. a 2.5 cm tumor mass that is white tan and firm around the edges and. slightly necrotic and hemorrhagic in the center. Tumor and normal. lung are collected for the tumor bank and for. lab for. further studies. A tied off vessel is grossly identified. This. vessel is sampled and assumed to be a vascular margin. A long. parenchymal staple margin is grossly identified in the specimen in the. shape of a Y. This margin measures 9 cm at its longest aspect and. there is also an arm of the staple margin that measures 4.2 cm. The. tumor mass appears to grossly abut the pleura. However, the tumor. mass is located approximately 1.6 cm from the closest staple margin. This staple margin is shaved and submitted in its entirety. The shave. suture margin is submitted in cassettes B-D. Sections are taken of. the tumor mass. Sectioning through the remainder of the lung. parenchyma does not reveal any other mass lesions. Sections of normal. lung are submitted. Additionally received with the specimen is a small. fragment of rib. This rib measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. Adherent. fibrous tissue is identified on the outer aspect of the rib. Focal. areas of blood clot are also identified on the outer surface of the. rib. No gross abnormalities are identified.

On sectioning, the cut surface is gray-black and friable. The. specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. E/EPC. The specimen is received in formalir and consists of a single lobe of. lung, weighing 212 grams and measuring 15 X 14 x 14 cm in overall dimensions. The hilar region consists of two portions of bronchus, measuring 1.5 cm in. length X 1.0 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in length X 1.0 cm in diameter. There. is also a 0.5 cm portion of vessel (the hilum). The structures are surrounded. by six gray-black lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest. dimension. There are also two stapled resection margins at the hilum,. measuring 7.5 cm in length and 2.0 cm in length. The stapled margins are. trimmed and inked green. The hilar region is inked black. The pleural. surface is purple-black with moderate anthracotic pigmentation. The surface. is smooth with the exception of the 0.5 cm area of puckering on the lateral. aspect. The pleural surface in this area is inked black. On sectioning,. there is a well-circumscribed mass adjacent to the puckered area which. measures 5 X 5 X 4.5 cm. The cut surface of the mass is yellow-tan soft and. gritty. with anthracotic pigmentation. The borders of the mass are rounded. serpiginous. The mass involves 40% of the cut surface and comes to within 1.0. cm of the vascular resection margin, 1.5 cm from the stapled resection margin,. and 1.8 cm from the bronchial resection margin. The mass surrounds vascular. and bronchial structures. On sectioning through the bronchus, the vessels are. yellow-tan and smooth. There is no obvious involvement of the bronchial and. vascular structures by the aforementioned mass. The mass abuts the inked. pleural surface. The remainder of the specimen consists of mildly crepitant. pink-red parenchyma. There is minimal anthracotic pigmentation.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'. It. consists of two irregular fragments of tan soft tissue measuring 0.8. X 0.5 X 0.2 cm and 0.6 X 0.4 X 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 2. Part two is received fresh, labeled 'right upper lobectomy'. It. consists of a portion of right upper lobe of lung, measuring 15.6 X. 3.8 cm. The staple line measures 15.5 cm. The staple line is shaved. and the pleura around the staple line is inked in green. The pleural. surface is pink tan glistening and reveals a thickened, bossellated. area with fibrous thickening. The bronchial margin measures 1.5 cm. and the vascular margin 1.2 cm. Beneath the thickened pleura there. is a firm gray area, measuring 1.5 X 1.5 X 1.0 cm, located 4.5 cm. from the staple line margin. Also noted a second separate firm gray. white area, measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension which upon. pressure exudes cheesy material. This mass is located 1 cm from the. staple line margin, also multiple anthracotic lymph nodes, ranging. from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm identified from the hilar area. Representative. sections are submitted. 3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'. It consists of three irregular fragments of tan soft tissue. measuring 1.5 X 0.7 X 0.3 cm, 1.5 x 1 X 0.2 cm and 0.5 X 0.5 X 0.2. cm. Entirely submitted in two cassettes. 4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node'. It consists of a 0.7 X 0.4 x 0.1 cm irregular portion of tan soft. tissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette. 5. Part five is received in saline, labeled 'additional right upper. lobe margin'. It consists of a 6.5 X 4.5 X 2.5 cm triangular-shaped. wedge of lung tissue, with a 6.5 cm long stapled line along one. edge, and two stapled lines along an adjacent edge measuring 3 cm. and 4 cm respectively. The specimen is photographed. The 6.5 cm. long stapled edge is inked black; the 3 cm long stapled edge. (adjacent to the 6.5cm long one) is inked blue; and the 4 cm long. stapled edge is inked green. The black and blue inked stapled lines. are at acute angles. The staples are trimmed off and the specimen. is serially sectioned, revealing no focal lesions or masses. Representative sections are submitted. 6. Part six is received in formalin, labeled 'rib'. It consists of. a 1.4 X 1.4 X 0.6 cm segment of rib with red marrow. Entire. specimen is submitted in one cassette, after decalcification. SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: 1A entirely submitted. 2A vascular margin. 2B bronchial margin. 2C-2J firm area. 2K staple line margin. 2L-2M second mass close to the staple line margin. 2N anthracotic lymph nodes. 3A-3B entirely submitted. 4A entirely submitted. 5A-5E representative sections. 6A rib, after decalcification. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Decalcification, AFB, GMS, Chromogranin, TTF1. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Genzyme Specimen #. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18-20% of. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and without identifiable. mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine. kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of. mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical. sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib. Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)). This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis.

TCGA-77-A5G6,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. No clinical notes. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled `right upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung. that has been previously sampled for research purposes. This lobe measures 140. mm (SI), 20 mm (ML) and 180 mm (AP). There is puckering of the pleural surface. on the anterolateral surface measuring up to 25 x 20 mm. Scarring is noted on. the posterolateral surface measuring up to 10 x 10 mm. The apex shows some. emphysematous changes. On sectioning a firm cream tan tumour with black. pigmentation is identified within the lung parenchyma. It has a maximum cut. surface area of 32 x 20 mm in dimension. The tumour is located 30 mm away from. the bronchial resection margin. It is located within 1 mm of the pleural. surface. [Representative sections: 1A, bronchial resection margin; 1B,. peribronchial node bisected; 1C-D, one node bisected, one slice each block; 1E,. one node bisected; 1F, sections of tumour nearest to pleural surface; 1G,. tumour; 1H, tumour and the surrounding lung parenchyma; 11, lung with. emphysematous changes; 1J, scarring of lung; 1K, presumed normal lung tissue;. IL, further bronchial margin.]. 2: The specimen is labelled `hilar lymph node' and consists of a lymph node. measuring 5 X 3 x 3 mm in dimension. [Bisected and BIT: 2A]. 3: The specimen is labelled 'No 4 and No 10 lymph node' and consists of. multiple pieces of yellow brown tissue ranging in size from smallest 5 x 3 x 3. mm to largest 32 x 25 x 20 mm. The largest node appears to be involved with. tumour. No extra capsular spread identified. [3A, four possible nodes; 3B-C 1RS. of largest node]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showing. areas of clear cell change. The tumour does not directly invade visceral. pleura. There is extensive lymphatic invasion with tumour present in adjacent. lymphatic channels within pleura, pulmonary septa and along the course of. bronchovascular bundles. Tumour is present within a lymphatic vessel at the. bronchial resection margin. No tumour is identified within bronchial wall at. the bronchial resection margin. The peribronchial lymph nodes are involved by. tumour. The tumour deposits are present within afferent lymphatic channels,. subcapsular sinuses, and are also distributed throughout lymph node parenchyma. Lymph node tissue also shows reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon. pigment deposition, scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent with. silicate, and hyalinized silicotic nodules. No vascular invasion or perineural. permeation by tumour is seen. Immediately adjacent to the tumour there is. a. localised area of endogenous lipoid pneumonia. Remaining lung parenchyma shows. emphysema and respiratory bronchiolitis. Vascularised pleural adhesions are. also present. 2: Sections reveal lymph node tissue which is partially involved by squamous. cell carcinoma showing clear cell change. 3: All sections (3A-3C) reveal lymph node tissue which is partially involved by. squamous cell carcinoma showing clear cell change. Lymph node tissue also. shows reactive changes with follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis, carbon. pigment deposition, scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent with. silicate, and hyalinized silicotic nodules.

Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of smoking. (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian population, common in. non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually. exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Addendum. PROBE Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/ CEP 7 SpectrumGreen Probe. TM. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 1.07 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 30% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. 60 cells were. analyzed in the targeted region. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Summary Statement. The right lower lobe superior segment demonstrates a 2.5 cm invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. associated with visceral pleural and angiolymphatic invasion. All sampled lymph nodes are benign. Surgical resection. margins are free of tumor. The pathologic stage is T2N0Mx. The right middle lobe demonstrates a 0.6 cm typical carcinoid. Numerous carcinold tumorlets and diffuse. neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia are seen throughout the right upper, right lower and right middle lobes. PART 1: LYMPH NODE, SUBCARINAL, BIOPSY -.

COMMENT: This case in addition to invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrates typical carcinoid in the right. middle lobe associated with numerous carcinoid tumorlets and diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. A primary lung. origin of carcinoid is confirmed by positive TTF-1 and synaptophysin immunostalning. CDX2 and calcitonin are negative. Surgical resection margin of the right middle lobe demonstrates scattered small microscopic foci of neuroendocrine. cells. However, based on the gross description it seems that margin is negative for tumor and these neuroendocrine. cells may represent another focus of tumoriet.

All lymphoid tissue submitted. is. negative for metastatic disease but discloses significant anthracosis. Scattered hyalinized and calcified granulomata are noted in parts F.,. L. and M which on H&E stain suggested the possibility of fungal. organisms. However, GMS stain for fungus was performed on part F.,. blocks L 9-11 and M and were all negative. No definite fungal. organisms, therefore, are identified. The stain for acid-fast bacilli. these blocks is negative. The right upper lobe specimen, part L, discloses two separate. carcinomas. The smaller one (2.5 cm) is a squamous cell carcinoma with. involvement of a nearby bronchus which also contains squamous cell. carcinoma in situ. This tumor has focal keratinization and necrosis,. sparing the pleura 1.5 cm away from this tumor is a 6.5 cm cavitating. moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. There is no apparent. communication or commingling of these tumor types. The periphery of. the invasive adenocarcinoma discloses bronchoalveolar architecture. The 2 densely adherent ribs overlie the vicinity of the adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma appears confined to the pulmonary parenchyma. Distal to the adenocarcinoma there is a marked ibro-inflammatory. response (containing occasional giant cells) which replaces the pleura. and extends to the surface of the ribs. There is no actual tumor in. this thick fibro-inflammatory layer and the ribs are negative for. tumor. Bronchial and vascular margins of resection are negative for. tumor. However, the staple line was trimmed away and the remaining. parenchymal surface painted with ink. Bronchoalveolar type carcinoma. extends to this ink.

TCGA-05-4397,"Extensive, central to peripheral bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma of histologically mixed. differentiation (G3), comprising partly maturing tubuloglandular cells and partly medium to. large cells and also clear cells, with partial necrotic alteration, invasion of the large pulmonary. vessels and the pleura. Tumor classification according to these findings pT2 pN1 V2 RX,. stage IIB. C34.2; M 8255/3. Comment/supplementary remark: The tumor invasion of the large pulmonary vessels with formation of lumen-obstructing. thrombi of polypoid growth extending beyond the resection margin is very unusual. The wall. adhesion of the carcinoma is minimally about 0.5 mm from the resection margin of the. vessels. The RX situation is likely explained by the fact that the tumor plug causing. intraluminal obstruction of the middle lobe also adheres to the wall at a site on the resection. margin. In addition, the tumor invasion in the pleura extends focally as far as the surface of. the pleura. The glandular maturation component is partly reminiscent of the fetal type of. bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. The smoldering or recurrent pneumonia is likely to have. been of retrostenotic origin. The lymph node with tumor is located in the hilus region. immediately next to one of the tumor-infiltrated large pulmonary vessels.",0.38,1

COMMENT: In Part 2, special stain for elastin shows that the neoplasm extends into but not through the visceral pleura. A. microscopic focus of neoplastic cells is present within the arterial wall at the vascular margin of resection. This. neoplastic focus is seen on the frozen section and not on permanent section. Deeper levels of this margin. are. non-. contributory. The frozen section slide was reviewed and our diagnosis regarding this margin remains unchanged. Given. the positive vascular margin, the tumor clusters in part 7( nodule on aortic arch) likely represents contiguos spread rather. than a true etastsis. Hence, this lesion is best classifies as Pt4 N2 Mx. In Part 7, cytokeratin stain confirms the presence of neoplastic cells of epithelial origin within the vessel wall. has been. ordered to confirm the epithelial origin of the neoplastic cells.

Microscopic Description: Sections of specimen #2 show a large cell malignant neoplasm that in. areas shows prominent gland formation. These glandular area blend. into more solid nests of neoplastic cells. These are supported by a. dense fibrous stroma and alternate with areas of necrosis. The. neoplasm extends into the pleural but not onto the pleural surface. Sections of the neoplasm within the right upper lobe specimen #3. show a large cell malignant neoplasm with a distinctly different. growth pattern. In this neoplasm the cells form sheets that have. irregular borders. The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic. cytoplasm and enlarged pleomorphic nuclei. Sections of the lymph node specimens show no areas of metastatic. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are performed on the neoplasm in the. right lower lobe specimen and right upper lobe specimen. The right. lower lobe specimen shows the neoplasm to be positive for CK7 and. negative for CK20. Some of the cells are strongly positive for. TTF1. These are in the more glandular areas. The more solid areas. are negative for this marker. The more solid areas do express. positivity for CDX-2 where the glandular areas tend to be negative. for this marker. The cells are negative for p63. This staining. pattern would support this being an adenocarcinoma of pulmonary. origin. It is unclear why some of the cells mark with the. colorectal marker CDX-2. This same panel performed on the right. upper lobe specimen show the neoplastic cells to be negative for. both CK7 and CK20. The cells are negative for CDX-2 and TTF1. The. cells are strongly positive for p63. This staining pattern would. support this being a squamous carcinoma that is very poorly. differentiated. The immunohistochemical control slides stain. appropriately. Final Diagnosis. Right lung lower lobe wedge biopsy #1 with frozen section: Negative for carcinoma.

Wedge left lower lobe: after removal of the angled, 13 cm long staple suture line, inflated, fixed lung. resection tissue measuring 10 X 2 cm at the base, up to 4.5 cm thick, with pleural margin. Visceral pleura shows. slightly reticulate blackish pigmentation with an eccentric 2 cm area of star-shape retraction. Under this is a. whitish tumor, 1.9 cm in size, with unclear demarcation, at a distance of 0.1 cm from the staple suture line. Rest. of parenchyma shows partial rarefaction with the formation of lacunae max. 0.2 cm in size. 2.) Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe measuring 17 x 7 cm at the base, up to 20.5 cm high. Central. bronchus resection plane located at the level of bifurcation B6. At the hilus two partly lesioned nodes, 0.7 cm. and 3 cm in size. A staple suture line runs from the hilus in a cranial direction for 4 cm, and a staple suture line. runs from the hilus in a caudoventral direction for 5.5 cm. At the laterobasal margin over S8-10 there is a 16 cm. staple suture line demarcating an arcuate defect (status post wedge resection). Visceral pleura, accentuated. lateral partly reticulate and partly patchy blackish pigmentation. Parenchyma in all segments rarefied with. formation of 0.3 cm lacunae. 3.) Parietal pleura: 2.7 cm plate-like tissue up to 0.4 cm thick. 4.) Lobar LN (station 12) left upper lobe: two node parts, 0.4 cm and 1.5 cm. 5.) Interlobar LN (station 11) left: 1.5 cm lesioned node. 6.) Hilar LN (station 10) left: 1.5 cm lesioned node and a small piece of fatty tissue. 7.) Pulmonary ligament LN (station 9) left: two node parts, each 0.8 cm. 8.) Prevascular and retrotracheal LN (station 3) left: 0.8 cm node part with surrounding tissue. 9.) Subcarinal LN (station 7): 2.2 cm lesioned node. 10.) Hilar LN (station 10) right: 1.5 cm node part. 11.) Skin squamous epithelium left thorax: excised skin specimen measuring 2 x 0.6 cm with central button-. like, raised, brown skin lesion of 0.7 cm, distance from the lateral resection margins at least 0.1 cm, at least 0.6. cm from the poles.

Description of histological and cytological findings omitted for capacity reasons. EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Peripheral, bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell nonkeratinizing squamous cell. carcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung evidently located in S9. TNM classification according to this. picture pT1 pN3 pMX L1 R0, stage III. C 34.3;M 8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Numerous non-necrotizing epithelioid cell granulomata, largely in paravasal interstitial sites. Slight centroacinar. pulmonary emphysema (samples 1.) and 2.)). Hypocellular fibrosis area of parietal pleura (sample 3.)). Lymph. nodes with large foci of epithelioid cell reaction, nodular, central partly necrotically altered areas of sclerosis. and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 4.) - 7.) and 9.)). Seborrheic keratosis of the skin of the akanthotic. type (sample 11.)). Remark/addendum: The carcinoma shows lymphangioinvasion at the tumor margin and has produced metastases in the hilar lymph. nodes of sample 2.) and in samples 8.) and 10.). The visceral pleura, the residual lower lobe of the lung,. including its resection margin of bronchus and vessels, and also the lymph nodes of samples 4.) and 7.) - 9.) are. tumor-free. The distribution pattern of epithelioid cell granulomata is primarily consistent with sarcoidosis. No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations,. especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung.",0.18,0

Received fresh for frozen section is a linear. fragment of cartilaginous mucosal lined tissue measuring 0.8 X 0.7 x 0.2 cm that is submitted in total for. frozen. The sixteenth container is additionally labeled, ""#16, left upper lobe."" Received is an orange cassette. in formalin which was previously submitted fresh for frozen. It holds a piece of tan-brown anthracotic lung. tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.8 X 0.3 cm. It is resubmitted entirely in cassette P1. Also received in the sixteenth container is a lung lobe without fixative, measuring 20.0 X 10.0 x 4.5. cm. The visceral pleura is mottled tan/purple and anthracotic/black. There is a mass measuring 4.0 x 3.5. X 3.5 cm at the apex of the lobe. The mass was previously cut for frozen section, and also previously to. that in the operating room after explant. The cut surface of tumor is tan and irregular, with solid and cystic. areas. The cystic areas are traversed by bands of tumor tissue. The mass appears to abut, but not. breach, the visceral pleura. Diffusely patchy areas surrounding the tumor are firmer to palpation than the. grossly uninvolved lung parenchyma. The staple line of the medial parenchymal resection margin is. removed and the cut surface inked black. The pleura over the tumor is inked blue. The tissue is then. serially sectioned to reveal the following: The primary tumor is 1.8 cm away from the nearest surgical. margin (medial parenchymal, black). It extends 3.0 cm deep into the lung tissue. It is well-circumscribed. but not encapsulated, with an irregular deep contour. There is an area of grainy tan-green/black tissue. 2.0 X 2.5 cm in maximum dimension lateral to the primary tumor. It too appears to touch but not breech. the overlying pleura. It appears dissimilar to the primary tumor, but still pathological compared to the. surrounding parenchyma. Similar foci of tan/green/black grainy tissue are scattered throughout the lung,. mostly inferiorly. None form discreet masses. The uninvolved parenchyma is a heterogeneous beefy. dark-red/anthracotic-black. One solid black perihilar lymph node is found. Representative sections are. submitted per the block summary.

Resident Pathologist: FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS --. FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE: STAPLED MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. The specimen is received fresh labeled. ind. designated right upper lobe. It consists of a grossly recognizable. lobe of lung that weighs 250 gms, and measures 20 x 9.5 x 3.5 cm. The. staple parenchymal margin measures 17 cm in length. The entire. parenchymal margin will be sampled for histology. One particular area. of concern raised by the surgeon was frozen with frozen section. diagnosis as above. There is in fact some firmness felt underneath the. parenchymal margin. Upon serially sectioning through the lung, this. area of firmness appears to be secondary to bronchopneumonia. A tumor. mass is identified which measures 3.2 cm in greatest dimension. This. white tan tumor mass approaches the parenchymal margin no closer than. 4.2 cm. Between this nodule and the overlying stapled parenchymal. margin is the area of firmness consistent with bronchopneumonia. There is however one additional smaller nodule that is white tan in. color measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. This other nodule is. separate from the main tumor nodule. This nodule is surrounded by the. firm gray tan tissue reminescent of pneumonia. This second nodule. approaches the stapled parenchymal margin, no closer than 2.2 cm. The. bronchial and vascular margins grossly appears well away from the. tumor and approach no closer that 4.0 cm from the main tumor mass,. and 6.2 cm from the other suspicious smaller nodule. In the area of. the lung adjacent to the tumor in the area away from the pneumonia. the lung appears focally cystic. The remainder of the lung specimen. is congested. No other lesions are identified. Black and white and. color photographs of the specimen are taken. In one region the tumor. appears grossly to approach the overlying pleural surface with some of. focal hardening and puckering of the surface. Representative sections. are submitted.

Tumor mass with green-inked puckered pleural surface. 7. Lung with emphysematous change. The specimen is remoyed from the patient at. and placed in. formalin at. for a minimum of. fixation per. protocol. B) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 9L. The specimen is received in formalin labeled ""level 9L lymph node."" It. consists of three red-black soft tissues aggregating 0.7 X 0.5 X 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette. C) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 5. The specimen is received fresh labeled ""level 5 lymph node."" It consists of. 1 X 1 X 0.2 cm of fragmented black-red tissue which is submitted in toto. for frozen on one block. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Negative for. carcinoma."" is rendered by. D) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 6. The specimen is received in formalin labeled ""level 6 lymph node."" It. consists of two tan-red soft tissues aggregating 0.9 X 0.4 X 0.2 cm. The. specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette. E) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 7. The specimen is received labeled ""level 7 lymph node."" It consists of a. single 1.2 cm anthracotic lymph node. The specimen is entirely submitted in. one cassette. F) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 12L. The specimen is received labeled ""level 12L lymph nodes."" It consists of. three anthracotic lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 cm in greatest. dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette. G) SOURCE: Left upper lobe bronchial margin for frozen section. Received fresh from the OR labeled ""left upper lobe bronchial margin for. frozen section and consists of a 3 g lung lobe (19 X 12 X 4 cm). The. bronchial resection margin is received stapled. The staple line is removed. and the subjacent tissue is taken en face for frozen section diagnosis. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSUL TATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ""Benign. bronchial margin"" is rendered by. The vascular margins and hilar lymph nodes are taken. The pleural surface. is tan-red to red-purple, smooth and glistening. There is a 9 cm staple. line grossly corresponding to the earlier wedge resection. The staple line. is removed and the subjacent tissue is inked blue. The staple line lies 4.5. cm from the bronchial resection margin. The lung lobe is sectioned. revealing pink-tan to red-purple spongy tissue. No discrete masses or. lesions are identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in nine cassettes as. follows: 1. Frozen section bronchial resection margin. 2. Hilar lymph nodes. 3. Vascular resection margins, en face. 4. Staple line nearest bronchial margin. 5. Additional inked staple line. 6-9. Grossly unremarkable lung parenchyma. This case is accessioned in. MICROSCOPIC. A) Sections through the wedge resection from the left upper lobe confirm. the presence of non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor is predominantly. composed of solid nests of cells with large vesicular nuclei and abundant. eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is fairly abundant and areas of. tumor necrosis are seen. The tumor is predominantly growing in solid nests. with minimal acinar formation, although occasional foci of both. intracellular and extracellular mucin are suggested. This lesion abuts but. does not appear to specifically infiltrate within the overlying visceral. pleura. Assessment in this regard includes an elastic stain on block A6. Noninvolved pulmonary parenchyma demonstrates nonspecific emphysematous. changes but is otherwise unremarkable. A limited immunohistochemical. evaluation of this lesion is performed with results as follows: TTF-1: Positive. Napsin A: Negative. Negative. P63: Limited/focal positivity is seen. The combination of TTF-1 positivity with apparent focal mucin production by. this neoplasm would confirm a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

TCGA-78-7633,"SEE SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT BELOW. HISTORY. Adenocarcinoma. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens submitted. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung. measuring 200 X 80 X 20 mm in the fresh state. Overlying the apex and the lateral. aspect of the apex of the lobe is an area of pleural tethering with an underlying tumour. mass. The remainder of the pleural surface shows no specific abnormality apart from. extensive carbon pigmentation. The lobar bronchus has been transected flush with the. hilar soft tissue and has two lumens at this point. Small peribronchial anthracotic. nodes are noted, none of which appears macroscopically to be involved by a tumour. Sectioning reveals an apical tumour mass which appears to be bilobed. The combined. maximum size of this lesion is 32 mm. The more superior lobule is approximately 20. mm in diameter and shows foci of central necrosis. The more lateral and inferior. lesion is approximately 12 mm in diameter and has a solid cream to tan cut surface. In some areas the lobules appear to be separated by 2 to 3 mm of unremarkable lung. parenchyma. Both lobules abut the overlying pleura. No other lesions are identified. on serial slicing through the parenchyma. However there is severe emphysema. [1A,. bronchial resection margin; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1D longitudinal. sections through tumour including overlying pleura and both lobules; 1E, sections of. inferolateral solid nodule with overlying pleura; 1F, uninvolved lung parenchyma.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled ""left hilar lymph node' and consists of three. fragments of focally anthracotic and fatty tissue. [BIT, 2A.]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show two adenocarcinomas. The first has a predominantly acinar architecture with a small. amount of surrounding bronchioloalveolar type growth. Extensive blood vessel invasion is noted and. there is possible lymphatic permeation. The other lesion is a papillary adenocarcinoma. The lesions. are separated by approximately 5 mm by unremarkable lung. A third focus of adenocarcinoma with a. bronchioloalveolar pattern is present within the random section of lung. This measures 5 mm in. diameter. Overlying both tumours, there is scarring of the pleura and features suspicious for invasion. Special stains will be performed. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the. bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The uninvolved lung shows evidence. of emphysema. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. 1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5. mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation. present. C: Possible pleural invasion identified; special stains being performed; clear of bronchial margin. D: No lymph node metastases. E: T1NO (awaiting pleural stains). F: Non-neoplastic lung: Mild emphysema. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. 1: Tumour invades into the visceral pleura overlying the tumour with the acinar architecture. It is not. definitely on the pleural surface. There is no invasion of the visceral pleura by the papillary carcinoma. Both tumours stain positively for CK 7 and TTF 1. CK 20 is negative. This indicates both lesions are. pulmonary in origin but considering their different architecture as they appear to represent synchronous. tumours. SUMMARY. 1-2: Left upper lobe and left hilar lymph nodes: A: Three foci of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; 20 mm (acinar), 12 mm (papillary) and 5. mm (bronchioloalveolar) in maximal dimension. B: Extensive blood vessel invasion; probable lymphatic permeation but no perineural permeation. present. C: Visceral pleural invasion identified overlying the acinar pattern carcinoma; clear of bronchial. margin. D: No lymph node metastases. E: T2 NO (acinar pattern carcinoma) T1N0 (papillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern carcinomas). F: Non-neoplastic lung: Mild emphysema. T-28000 M-81403 P1-03000.",0.78,1

Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled 'right upper lobe' and consists of a right upper lobectomy. measuring 145 X 105 X 45 mm. On the medial surface, inferior the hilum is a staple. line measuring 70 mm in length. This is removed (4 mm of tissue) and it, and the. bronchial margin is inked blue. There is extensive puckering of the pleura superiorly. at the apex over a distance of 40mm. This surface has been inked black. Underneath. the puckering is a tan and black nodule with a pushing edge that measures 52 X 51 X. 40 mm. The tumour appears to abut the pleural surface in multiple areas. It is 20 mm. from the bronchial resection margin. No other lesions are identified within the lung. [1A, bronchial margin; 1B, two hilar lymph nodes; 1C-F, RS of tumour including. pleura; 1G, RS of normal lung tissue Note: specimen has been sampled for research]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""number 10 lymph node' and consists of four pieces of tan. and black tissue, the largest piece measuring 15 X 12 X 10 mm.

Part of the tumour is composed. of elastotic scarring. The lesion is subpleural and focal visceral pleural invasion is. identified. Blood vessel and probable lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural. permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. Away from the tumour, the lung shows evidence. of mild emphysema and a patchy mild inflammation including interstitial chronic. inflammation, small numbers of airspace and interstitial non-necrotising granulomata. and rare plugs of organising pneumonia. The inflammation is best seen adjacent the. tumour but focally involves the distant lung. 2: Sections of the lymph node fragments show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of. malignancy. Prominent sinus histiocytosis is noted. 3: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. Prominent sinus histiocytosis is noted. SUMMARY.

Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled 'right upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy specimen. measuring 140 X 120 X 75 mm in its partially inflated state. Two bronchi are present. at the margin measuring 10 to 12 mm in diameter respectively. Two staple lines are. also present radiating from the bronchial margin to the periphery. They measure 35. and 80 mm in length. A large lymph node is present adjacent to the bronchial. resection margin. The cut surface of the lung shows a central lobulated tumour. measuring 39 X 32 X 30 mm. The cut surface has areas of necrosis and carbon. pigment. It appears to overrun several central peribronchial lymph nodes. Numerous. smaller non-involved peribronchial lymph nodes are also identified. Tumour. compresses one of the main bronchi towards the hilum. It lies approximately 10 mm. from the bronchial margin and appears clear of the soft tissue margin. It is 5 mm. from the nearest pleural surface. The distal lung shows evidence of collapse,. consolidation and bronchiectasis. There also areas of parenchymal haemorrhage,. likely iatrogenic. Two 1 to 2 mm tan nodules are seen within the collapsed zone,. distal to the tumour. There are also two firm granular areas within the lung. parenchyma away from the tumour. These range in size from 4 to 5 mm in greatest. dimension. The residual lung parenchyma shows mild emphysema away from the. areas of collapse, however this is difficult to assess.

Two specimens submitted. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left lower lobe"" and consists of a lobectomy. specimen of lung measuring 180 X 100 X 30 mm. The bronchial resection margin. consists of two bronchi immediately adjacent to each other measuring 14 and 7. mm in diameter each. The main bronchial branches are patent and easily probed. On the ante-hilar surface of the specimen there is puckering of the pleural. surface with an underlying relatively well defined firm mass. Sectioning. reveals a relatively well circumscribed cream to yellow and focally anthracotic. pigmented tumour measuring 27 mm in maximum extent. The tumour does not appear. to involve a large bronchus. The tumour is well clear of resection margins. No other focal lesions are identified elsewhere within the specimen. [TS of. bronchial resection margin and vascular resection margins-1A; peribronchial. lymph nodes 1B-1C; RS of tumour to include overlying serosal surface 1D-1F; RS. A. of normal appearing lung parenchyma distant from tumour-1G; sections of tumour. and normal lung taken for lung tumour research projects.]. N. A. 2: The second specimen is labelled ""left hilar lymph node"" and consists of two. small pieces of pink to cream soft tissue measuring 6 and 10 mm in maximum. T. extent respectively. One small firm lymph node measuring 3 mm in diameter is. palpable. [Both pieces of tissue BIT-2A.]. O. M. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a. combination of patterns including acinar, papillary and cribriform patterns. C. Scattered psammoma bodies are seen. Around the edge of the tumour, there is an. A. extensive lepidic component. The lesion is subpleural but pleural invasion is. not identified. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic permeation. L. is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of. the bronchial resection margin. No lymph node metastases are seen. The. adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema and focal respiratory bronchiolitis. P. Distal to the tumour, there is a small area of subpleural interstitial fibrosis. with no characteristic features. Within the section of uninvolved lung, there. A. is a well circumscribed non-necrotising granuloma within the interstitium and a. few further smaller more poorly formed granulomata. No polarisable material is. T. seen.

Macroscopy: The specimen consists of left lung, the upper lobe measuring 290 x 110 x 40 mm. and the lower lobe measuring 275 x 110 X 65 mm. Present 30 mm from the. proximal resection margin there is a white sclerotic nodule measuring 32 mm in. maximal dimension. It appears to be arising from the main bronchus and where. it branches into the bronchus supplying the lower lobe. The mucosa of the. bronchus surrounding the tumour is somewhat nodular but this does not extend to. the margin. The tumour appears to invade into adjacent lymph nodes and has a. sclerotic appearance. No other lesions are seen. On sectioning of the. uninvolved lung, there is some black anthracotic speckling. The tumour appears. clear of the pleura by approximately 7 mm. [Sections taken: bronchial. resection margin, A; peribronchial lymph nodes, B-C; tumour and proximal. bronchus, D; further RS of tumour, E-G; RS right upper lobe, H; lower lobe, I]. Microscopy: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which is. arising around large bronchi and extending into peribronchial soft tissue. Perineural permeation and areas suspicious for lymphatic invasion are seen but. no blood vessel invasion is identified. Peribronchial lymph node involvement. is noted. The tumour is clear of bronchial, soft tissue and pleural margins. Adjacent to the carcinoma, in situ squamous cell carcinoma is seen. Again,. this is well clear of the bronchial margin. The adjacent lung shows mild. emphysema. 2: HILAR NODES. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a piece of fatty tissue containing blackened lymph. node tissue. It measures 24 x 16 x 10 mm.

TCGA-78-7537,"HISTORY. Tissue taken at lobectomy. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper lobectomy which measures. 140 X 120 x 50 mm in maximum dimension. On palpation there is a firm to hard mass located in the. apical segment, predominantly on the posteromedial aspect. The mass measures approximately 60 X 65. X 40 mm in maximum dimension. There is puckering of the overlying pleural surface at the apex. The. pleural surface on the medial aspect of the specimen has a fibrinous-type exudate. On sectioning there. is a solid lobulated tumour which has a yellow greyish-white cut surface. It, in places, has a villous-. like architecture. There is haemorrhage scattered throughout the tumour. The tumour appears to abut. the pleural surface. The tumour appears to lie at least 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin. There is a soft tissue resection margin which has a row of staples and measures 85 mm in length. The. tumour is well clear of this. The surrounding adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma has a collapsed. appearance. [1A, bronchial resection margin; 1B-F, tumour; 1G, adjacent uninvolved lung. parenchyma; 1H, hilar lymph nodes]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of four irregular greyish-black pieces of. tissue which measure in aggregate 30 x 20 X 10 mm. [BIT, 2A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a well differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a prominent. bronchioloalveolar component with a marked papillary pattern. The cells are tall and columnar with. variable cytoplasm ranging from non-mucinous to clear to mucinous. The lesion is subpleural but. definite pleural invasion is not identified. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic. permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial. resection margin. Tumour appears to be present at a diathermied margin, possibly related to pleura in. block 1F. It is difficult to know whether this represents a true margin. No lymph node metastases are. present. The adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. Within the random section of lung, there. is. a localised area of necrosis with surrounding fibrosis. Special stains for microorganisms will be. performed. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Right upper lobe lung and hilar lymph nodes: 1: Well differentiated adenocarcinoma; 65 mm in maximal dimension. 2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present. 3: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin but extends to an area of diathermy (see. report). 4: No lymph node metastases. 5: T2N0MX. 6: Emphysema and necrotic lesion; special stains for microorganisms being performed.

Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Pleural tissue with marked chronic inflammation, blood pigment deposit and fibrous thickening (sample 1.)). Extensive tumor necroses. Active chronic organizing pneumonia in the tumor environment. Moderate to marked. active chronic peripheral bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Foci of fibrin-rich and chronic granulating visceral. neuritis over S1. Hypocellular fibrosis zone of the adherent part of the parietal pleura (sample 2.)). Lymph. nodes with uncharacteristic reactive lesions, anthracotic pigment deposits and sclerosis zones (samples 2.) and. 4.) )-11.)). Remark/addendum: The tumor extends to the adherent part of the parietal pleura and the soft portions of the co-resected parts of the. chest wall. With regard to the localization data, sample 3.) shows a discontinuous spread of the carcinoma. within pleura enlarged by fibrosis and showing fibrinous chronic inflammation, although no conclusion can be. drawn as to whether this is a visceral or parietal layer. The resection margins of bronchus and vessels of the. main preparation, the costal segments of the chest wall tissue, the repeat resection material from the pleura in. sample 1.) and all excised lymph nodes are tumor-free. The R1 category is explained by the fact that the tumor. has spread focally as far as resection surface of the adherent part of the parietal pleura adjacent to the chest wall. No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes, but much further-reaching investigations,. especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung.",0.25,0

TCGA-77-7463,"LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY. Clinical Details: FNA: Squamous cell carcinoma. Macroscopy: The specimen weighs 180 g and comprises a lobe of lung with appearances in keeping with left upper. lobe. Within the superior lingular segment there is a tumour nodule measuring 30 x 28 x 25 mm. It is. situated at a distance of 25 mm from the bronchial resection margin. The tumour has caused puckering. of the overlying pleura. No pleural surface involvement is seen macroscopically. Inferior to this. nodule, at a distance of 20 mm, there is a hard circumscribed fibrous nodule showing central caseation,. measuring 14 mm in maximum diameter. Within the anterior segment there is a subpleural dark grey. nodule measuring 6 mm in maximum diameter. The lung parenchyma otherwise appears normal. [A,. bronchial resection margin to lingular segment; B, bronchial resection margin to anterior and apico-. posterior segments; C, lymph nodes at resection margin; D, small subpleural nodule anterior segment;. E, apex; F, anterior segment; G, nodule lingular segment; H-K, RS of tumour including pleura in each. section (note: an endobronchial origin is not identified macroscopically)]. Microscopy: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which abuts but does not directly. invade the pleura. However there is lymphatic permeation which does involve pleural lymphatics. No. vascular invasion is identified. Peribronchial lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.

TCGA-78-7154,"HISTORY. Left lobe lobectomy upper. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens submitted. 1: The specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a left upper lobe of lung measuring 220 X. 90 X 17 mm. A large area of parietal pleural adhesion is noted on the anterolateral surface. Beneath. this a firm mass is palpable within the anterior segment. On sectioning a mass is confirmed within the. lung. The mass measures 40 X 17 X 32 mm and has a cream to tan cut surface with black streaking. The tumour lies adjacent to the area of thickened and adherent pleura. The tumour is over 25 mm away. from the medial pleural surface and is well clear of the posterior pleural surface. The tumour is at least. 40 mm away from the bronchial resection margin. The uninvolved lung tissue appears unremarkable. [1A, bronchial resection margin; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C, tumour with adherent lateral. pleura; 1D, adjacent medial pleural margin; 1E-1F, further sections through tumour; 1G, uninvolved. lung]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""lymph node No. 5"" and consists of a single fragment of cream fatty tissue. containing grey-black lymph nodes. The specimen measures 25 X 18 X 7 mm. No obvious. involvement by tumour is noted on sectioning. [Bisected and BIT, 2A-B]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which invades into the. overlying adherent parietal pleura but appears clear of the soft tissue resection margin. Definite. vascular or lymphatic invasion is not identified. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in one of the. peribronchial lymph nodes with transcapsular extension into adjacent hilar fibrofatty tissue and. perineural and intraneural invasion in this region. The bronchial resection margin is clear of. malignancy but shows several foci of squamous metaplasia and low-grade dysplasia. Distant lung. parenchyma shows focal organising pneumonia, congestion and emphysema. 2: Sections show partial replacement of the lymph nodes by metastatic carcinoma with transcapsular. extension into the adjacent fibrofatty tissue.

TNM classification pT4 pN2 V1 RX, stage IIIB. C 34.1 M 8255/3. Comment/supplementary remark: The tumor is obviously primarily peripheral in location, has focally infiltrated the parietal. layer in the region of the pleural adhesion zone located over the tumor and is possibly. extending in a continuous perivascular sleeve into the hilum of the superior lobe, where it has. formed a further relatively large manifestation involving parabronchial lymph nodes. A. separate satellite focus can also be found in S3. The central tumor manifestation has infiltrated. the pulmonary venous wall and extends at least very close in the fatty tissue to the hilar. resection margin.

Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking. The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR targeted therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21. mutations are present in about 10% of. and up to 40% in the. population, common in. and. associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and. their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy. number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease,. time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitors. Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in. chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence. of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying. patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML4/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with. KRAS and EGFR mutations. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: SUMMARY STATEMENT.

Macroscopy: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measuring approximately. 165 X 100 x 55 mm in the inflated state. There are two staple lines present on the medial aspect of the. specimen. Both of these are excised and the resultant margins inked with black ink. The lateral pleural. surface is puckered over an area measuring approximately 15 X 6 mm. On sectioning through the lung. parenchyma there is a firm cream nodule present deep to this puckering which measures 45 mm in. greatest dimension. This lesion appears to abut the overlying pleura and is 21 mm from the nearest. parenchymal resection margin. No endobronchial component of the lesion is identified. macroscopically. The adjacent lung parenchyma appears unremarkable. [RS taken through bronchial. and vascular resection margins-1A; peribronchial lymph node-1B; tumour with overlying pleural. surface 1C-1E; parenchymal resection margin-1F; section through adjacent uninvolved lung-1G.]. Microscopy: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The lesion is subpleural and the tumour. invades into but not through the visceral pleura. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic. permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial. and the surgical resection margin. A peribronchial lymph node metastasis of adenocarcinoma is seen. Abutting the carcinoma in block 1 F is a carcinoid tumourlet. The adjacent lung shows very mild. centriacinar emphysema.

PRIOR MALIGNANCY: None given. CHEMORADIATION THERAPY: None given. ORGAN TRANSPLANT: None given. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: None given. OTHER DISEASES: Yes,. CYTOGENETIC TESTS: Not given. ADDENDA: Addendum.

EGFR Exon 21 mutation NOT identified. E. EML4/ALK rearrangement NOT identified (see In Situ Procedure). Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking. The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistance to EGFR targeted therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21. mutations are present in about 10% of. and up to 40% in the. population, common in. and. associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and. their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy. number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease,. time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitors. Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in. chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence. of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying. patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML4/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with. KRAS and EGFR mutations. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Summary Statement. The right upper lobectomy and superior segmentectomy of the right lower lobe reveals a 2.4 cm poorly differentiated. mucin-producing adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe, 2.4 cm in diameter, associated with angiolymphatic and. visceral pleural invasion with involvement of the right paratracheal lymph nodes, with all margins free.

FOUR (4) FRAGMENTS OF LYMPH NODE WITH REACTIVE CHANGE. NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY. COMMENT: The adenocarcinoma is an interesting one having both moderate and poorly differentiated areas, with the former. characterized by cells with abundant vacuolated foamy, light eosinophilic cytoplasm surrounding pools of mucin. In. some areas, psammoma bodies are identified, and in still other areas zones of solid growth are prominent. In several. areas, focal squamous differentiation is seen, however, this comprises only a small percentage of the overall tumor. (<10%) and therefore, we have chosen not to classify this as an adenosquamous carcinoma. CASE SYNOPSIS: SYNOPTIC DATA: - PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS. TUMOR LOCATION: Right Upper Lobe.

Received in formalin is an ovoid soft tissue fragment, 1.5 X 0.5 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is bisected. and submitted in toto in one block. F. Received fresh is a lung resection specimen, which is anatomically distorted, with multiple staple lines. The pleural. surface is intact, pale purple-blue without any areas of obvious puckering. There is a main stem bronchus extending from. the specimen for a distance of 4 cm. Surrounding this bronchus are multiple subcarinal lymph nodes. Attached to the. anterior lateral surface of the specimen are three ribs. The lung measures 21 x 14 x 8 cm in greatest dimension. The. attached rib measures 12.5 cm in length and 7.5 cm in aggregate diameter. Upon opening the specimen along the. bronchial tree, there is a cystic mass replacing the majority of the lung parenchyma. It measures 9.3 x 8.5 x 8 cm in. greatest dimension. The cystic mass is unilocular. The wall of the mass is at most 2.5 cm in thickness. Centrally located. within the cyst is hemorrhagic and necrotic fluid.

TCGA-66-2800,"Material examined: Right upper lobe and others. Clinical diagnosis and question. Right upper lobe bronchial carcinoma, status after asbestosis?. REPORT ON FINDINGS. Macroscopy. 1) Right upper lobe: inflated, fixed preparation measuring 19 x 14 x 6.5 cm, with predominantly shiny pleural. surface, altogether slightly patchy or reticulate, grayish black markings. Laterobasal zone of adhesion over S2. and the border area of segments 2 and 3, where there was a part of the chest wall up to 12 x 9 cm in size. including a rib segment 5.8 cm long. In addition a membranous part of the adhesive parietal pleura, fatty in. places, 12 x : 9 cm in size lying clear over S2 and S1. The latter extensively covered the lateral parts of S2 and. bordering sections of S1 and was mainly without adhesion to the visceral pleura. There was another zone of. adhesion in a medial direction, at about the point of attachment of the part of the chest wall, attached by a. parenchymal flap enclosed by a row of clip sutures 6.5 x 5 x 2 cm in size (part of S6? middle lobe?). A nodular. tumor, maximum 6.2 cm in size, at the base of S2, with dirty, whitish section surfaces, also focal grayish yellow. softening, sharp and markedly arched distinction from the adjacent parenchymal tumor on one side, on the. other side continuous infiltration of the visceral pleura and extension to the parenchymal flap attached. medially, where it extended to just by the base of the preparation and the row of clip sutures. In the region of. the contact point with the part of the chest wall, blackish thickening of the fused pleural lamina. Central. discontinuation of B2 about 1.7 cm distally of the bifurcation in the tumor tissue, also of one of the sub-. segment branches of B3. The other bronchial branches free as far as the peripheral sections. About 3.5 cm. away from the principal tumor in S1 a second, rather irregularly formed, pale grey tumor 1.6 cm in size in the. sub-pleural parenchyma, distance from pulmonary tissue with normal section surfaces to the pleura about 3. mm. Central bronchial resection line located immediately proximal of the segment division point, by the. bronchial stump a moderately solid node with dark grey pigment, 2.2 cm in size, damaged in places. 2) Lobar LN (item 12) upper lobe: irregular, predominantly heavily pigmented fragment of 1.8 cm. 3) Lobar LN (item 12) right lower lobe: node with blackish pigment, 1.8 cm in size, with some surrounding. tissue. 4) Inter-lobar lymph node (item 11) right: two fragments with largely blackish pigment, of 0.7 and 1.2 cm. 5) Hilar LN (item 10) right: two nodes with grayish black pigment, 1.3 and 1,8 cm in size. 6) Hilar LN (item 10) right (no. II): node 2.7 cm in size, apparently damaged and with blackish pigment, with. some surrounding fatty tissue. Borderline dubious small portion of a similar node. 7) Subcarinal LN (item 7): two preparations 1.2 and 2.3 cm in size with parts of at least 3 nodes with grayish. black pigment up to 1.7 cm. 8) Low paratracheal LN (item 4) right: preparation rich in fatty tissue, 4.5 cm in size, with nodes, pale grey in. places, blackish in places, between 0.3 and 1.2 cm. A further blackish node or partial node, 0.5 cm in size. 9) Low paratracheal LN (item 4) right + left: fragment of fatty tissue 3.3 cm in size, inclusion of 3 nodes or. partial nodes each up to 1.2 cm. 10) Prevascular and retrotracheal node (item 3) right: longitudinal fragment of fatty tissue of 2.5 cm with two. nodes or partial nodes with blackish pigment up to 1.2 cm. 11) High paratracheal LN (item 2) right: node 1.4 cm in size with slate grey to reddish section surface and some. fatty tissue attached, containing another small, pale grey node 2 mm in size. 12) Lipoma: rounded, flat preparation 3.7 X 3 x 1.8 cm in size, with largely smooth, surface obviously covered. by a soft capsule. Section surfaces largely golden yellow, grayish red border area measuring 7 mm in length. Examined. 1) Tumor and part of chest wall, tumor with attached parenchymal flap (where the section surface was. marked in color), 2 small apical tumor foci, 2 pieces of parenchyma free of tumor (S1 dorso-apical, S3 ventral,. central bronchial resection line and vascular displacement borders, nodes by the bronchial stump (laminated),. 4 pieces of parietal pleura. 2) - 7), 9) - 11) Total material in each case (small, isolated node in 11),. 8) Isolated node,. 12) 2 sections,. 20 blocks, Elastica-v.Gieson, PAS, diastasis PAS, iron. Microscopy. 1) The large tumor made up of small and large solid links of varying lengths, reticulate or branched in places,. and of occasional evident large atypical epithelial cells coated in epidermoid cells, with ample, in the main. weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei showing major variation in coarse chromatin nuclear structure. Numerous apoptoses, frequently at least five mitoses in a highly magnified viewing field. No inclusion of. mucin, instead intercellular bridges were repeatedly identified. In the center of solid tumor cell links,. degenerative changes in kariopyknoses and occasionally instances of cells showing dyskeratotic keratosis near. small and large areas of necrosis. Basic pulmonary tissue completely destroyed, development of fibrous. connective tissue moderately rich in cells with inclusion of inflammatory cells and vessels with thick walls,. some of which were filled with tumor cell links. Pleural border exceeded by tumor over a broad area in the. region of a lobar cleft, also incursion into the visceral pleura over a broad area, where the adhesive part of the. parietal pleura was free of tumor, only fibrotic. In addition here more pronounced chronic inflammatory cell. infiltrate. Towards the exterior including transversely striped muscle and intact rib bones with hematopoetic. cells of all kinds and to a lesser extent fat cells in the marrow cavity. In the small tumor focus also nests and. links of a solid, large cell tumor with characteristics of squamous cell epithelium structure, with here a short. stretch of replacement of original respiratory epithelium of a peripheral bronchus by atypical squamous cell. epithelium. Also destruction of the underlying pulmonary tissue, which was replaced by collagen and elastic. connective tissue, enclosed follicular lymphocyte aggregate and other inflammatory cells. Partially widened. airways in the pulmonary tissue free of tumor, slight deposition of anthracotic pigment in peribronchiolovasal. connective tissue and alveolar parenchyma with quite predominantly soft interstices. No evidence of tumor at. the displacement borders of the bronchus and large pulmonary vessels, respiratory mucosa normal. Lymph. nodes at the hilus with deposition of anthracotic pigment, accumulation of large macrophages and a few. secondary follicles. Adjacent lobes of the parietal pleura mainly entirely soft, only stretches of development of. slightly fibrotic connective tissue. Substantial adjacent fatty tissue in places. 2) - 11) Lymph nodes and parts of lymph nodes of various sizes with only occasional secondary follicles,. expansion of the paracortical or T zone, increase in capillary vessels in places, deposition of anthracotic pig-. ment of varying thicknesses and small focus of trabecular sclerosis. Small nerve stems and vessels of various. lumen sizes in the surrounding fatty tissue, including in sample 7) a small artery. 12) Fatty tissue in the shape of small lobes in places made up of single-vacuole fat cells, several enclosed. capillary vessels and narrow and broad bands of transversely striped muscle, which were also found in the. border areas. EVALUATION. Right upper pulmonary lobe with one large and one small focus of a poorly differentiated, large cell squamous. cell carcinoma not tending towards keratinization. The large tumor located in S2 and adjacent parts of. segment 3, extending from the center to the periphery, encroaching over the part of segment 6 or the middle. lobe removed and infiltrating the pleural over a broad area, is therefore probably primarily a peripheral. bronchopulmonary carcinoma with a satellite node in the lobe on the same side. The adhesive part of the. parietal pleura above the tumor was not infiltrated by the tumor, and the soft tissue and the resected part of. the ribs were also free of tumor. Partial necrotic alteration of the principal tumor, with vascular incursions in. this as well. Pulmonary parenchyma free of tumor largely normal, no hyaline plural plaque in the resected. pleura. Displacement borders of bronchus and large pulmonary vessels and all removed lymph nodes free of. tumor. An intramuscular lipoma in sample 12) without criteria for malignancy.

TCGA-77-7337,"LEFT PNEUMONECTOMY AND LYMPH NODES. Clinical Details: Nil supplied. Two specimens submitted: 1: (L) LUNG. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a left lung which, in the inflated state, measures 200 mm in height X 165 x 60. mm. Fatty and fibrous adhesions are attached to the apex of the upper lobe where there is a scarred. area approximately 35 mm in diameter. The pleura is slightly roughened over the mediastinal aspect of. the upper lobe, approximately 50 mm in maximum dimension, under which a tumour is palpable. Fatty. tissue to a depth of 40 mm is present inferior to the bronchial resection margin and this contains. numerous lymph nodes which are small and black. Numerous large lymph nodes, which measure up to. 35 mm in maximum dimension, are present superior to the bronchial resection margin. On cut surfaces. the tumour is seen to be 55 mm in maximal dimension, poorly circumscribed, soft and grey and black,. but with a necrotic centre. It extends right up to the pleura on the hilar surface of the lung and also to. the pleura in the oblique fissure. The tumour appears to be arising from a segmental bronchus,. probably that of the apicoposterior bronchus of the upper lobe. It is well clear of the bronchial. resection margin. Uninvolved tissue between the tumour and the apex of the upper lobe is generally. indurated and that in the basal aspect of the lobe is collapsed. Large black lymph nodes are present. around major segmental bronchi in the lower lobe. No tumour is evident in the lower lobe and the. parenchyma is generally normal-appearing apart from an area approximately 10 mm in maximum. dimension towards the base which appears to be an area of haemorrhage. [Lymph nodes inferior to the. left main bronchus are sampled in 1A-1D: those superior to the left main bronchus are sampled in 1E-. 11; blocks F-G contain one large lymph node; TS of bronchial resection margin in 1J: adjacent TS in. 1K: segmental bronchus with tumour in 1L-1M; tumour plus pleura on hilar surface in 1N-1P; tumour. plus pleura and adjacent lung in the oblique fissure in 1Q-1R; tumour with adjacent lung in 1S; further. lymph nodes around bronchus in 1T; apex of upper lobe in 1U; tissue from base of upper lobe in 1V;. bronchus and lymph nodes to lower lobe in 1W; tissue from apex of lower lobe in 1X and from base of. lower lobe (probable area of haemorrhage) in 1Y]. Microscopy: Sections show a moderately differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma which completely. occludes a segmental bronchus. There is no evidence of lymphatic or vascular invasion, but tumour. directly invades several hilar lymph nodes. Tumour is clear of the pleura in all sections, and is also. clear of the bronchial resection margin. Lung distal to the tumour shows marked secondary obstructive. changes including active airway inflammation and organising pneumonia. Tissue from the lower lobe. shows no definite pathological features. Conclusion: Left pneumonectomy: Squamous cell carcinoma; pathological stage T2 N1. 2: NO. 5 NODE. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of three pieces of rubbery dark-brown tissue, 10 mm, 10 mm and 5 mm in. maximum dimension. [The largest piece is bisected and the whole specimen is in block 2A]. [ET]. Microscopy: Sections show lymph nodes in which there are reactive changes but no evidence of metastatic. carcinoma. Conclusion: No. 5 lymph node: No evidence of malignancy.

EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Central and locally advanced bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell, focally. keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of left lung with main localization in the upper lobe. TNM classification according to this picture pT4 pN2 pMX V1 R0, stage III. C14 1 M8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Bronchiectases peripheral to the tumors mainly in the lingula and focal retention signs of lung parenchyma in. S5. In the subpleural region and the mantle zone of S1 manifest moderate pulmonary emphysema. Pleural. adhesion zone at the apex of the upper lobe (sample 1.). Lymph nodes with reactive lesions and anthracotic. pigment deposits (samples 2. - 6., 8. and 9.). Remark/addendum: The carcinoma has spread to the distal part of the main bronchus and associated fatty tissue directly localized to. the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus, which results in the category pT4. The tumor has also spread to. within 20 micrometers of the hilar resection surface. Metastases are seen in the peribronchial and hilar lymph. nodes in the main preparation and the lymph node of sample 7. The resection margin of bronchi and vessels, the. visceral pleura, the co-resected piece of pericardial sac and the lymph nodes of samples 2. - 6, 8. and 9. are. tumor-free. No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes.

TCGA-77-8139,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. RUL cancer. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens submitted. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a. lobectomy specimen of lung measuring approximately 180 x 120 x 36 mm. The. bronchial resection margin measures approximately 15 mm in external diameter. Peripherally within the specimen there is an ill-defined firm mass palpable. within the lung with attachment to adjacent parietal pleura and a portion of. three ribs which range in length from 38 mm to 75 mm. Elsewhere the pleura. appears normal. The tumour is at least 55 mm in diameter and extensively. invades the intercostal soft tissue including muscle. The lesion however. appears clear of the soft tissue resection margins. The tumour appears. intimately associated with the periosteum of the longest rib segment centrally. [Shave of bronchial resection margin and peribronchial lymph nodes, 1A; shave. of peribronchial vascular resection margin and section of peripheral normal. lung, 1B; sections of tumour, 1C-1E; sections of tumour in relation to parietal. pleura and chest wall, 1F-1I; TS of longest segment of rib in relation to. tumour, 1J.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled ""lymph node hilar"" and consists of multiple. small lymph nodes and a single larger node measuring 14 mm in maximum extent. [Small nodes BIT-2A; larger node-2B.]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which. invades the pleura and into soft tissue of the chest wall including intercostal. muscle. The soft tissue resection margins are clear of malignancy. No. vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion is identified. Tumour stroma. contains a heavy plasmacytic infiltrate but tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes are. not prominent. The bronchial resection margin is well clear of malignancy but. shows patchy squamous metaplasia and focal mild dysplasia. The lung parenchyma. adjacent to the tumour shows patchy organising pneumonia. Distant lung. parenchyma shows severe emphysema. The peribronchial lymph nodes show no. evidence of metastatic carcinoma. Report to follow on decalcified section of rib. 2: Sections show lymph nodes with reactive changes only. There is no evidence. of metastatic carcinoma. SUMMARY. Right upper lobectomy, chest wall resection and hilar lymph nodes sampling: Histopathology Report. Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, approx. 55 mm in diameter. Chest wall invasion present; soft tissue resection margins clear of malignancy. No vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion found. No lymph node metastases present. Pathological stage T3 NO. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT.

Other: Focal pulmonary infarcts. MMENT. 6. Sections of specimen 6 show soft tissue with rare small clusters of. tumour cells. One such cluster demonstrates probable perineural invasion. 8. Sections show two separate tumors composed of poorly differentiated. carcinoma with focal suggestion of squamous differentiation. The larger. tumor is found superiorly in the lower lobe. This tumor invades and. puckers the overlying pleura, but chest wall invasion and invasion into. the upper lobe are not identified. However, a second tumor is identified. more centrally in the upper lobe. This is separate from the RLL tumor,. measures 3 cm in greatest dimension, and shows similar histology to that. of the RLL tumor. The tumor demonstrates extensive vascular invasion,. including invasion of some larger vessels, and several pulmonary infarcts. are noted in the upper lobe. Multiple peribronchial lymph nodes are. involved by tumor, including by direct invasion of the RUL tumor. By. immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells show strong cytoplasmic staining. for. 5/6, focal moderate staining for high and low molecular weight. cytokeratin, and moderate to strong nuclear staining for p63. The tumor. cells are negative for cytokeratin 7 and 20, and TTF-1. The morphological. and immunohistochemical features are consistent with poorly. differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Given the morphologic. similarities between the RUL and RLL tumors and the extent of vascular. invasion, the RUL tumor is strongly favored to represent a metastasis. from the RLL tumor. The pathologic stage is therefore assessed to be. pT2N1M1. 3 of 10. CLINICAL HISTORY. LUNG CA. GROSS DESCRIPTION. 1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as ""Lymph-Node: ST9.

TCGA-77-8136,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. Left pneumonectomy plus lymph node biopsies. [Note previous cytology from. Bronchial brushings showing. atypia suspicious for malignancy; bronchial washings negative.]. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""left pneumonectomy"" and consists of a left lung. which measures 240 mm from the apex to the base, 165 mm from posterior to. anterior and up to 50 mm from lateral to medial. It weighs 343 g. The hilum. is distorted by a large tumour nodule which appears to involve both the apical. segment of the lower lobe and the superior lingular segment of the upper lobe. Mucopus protrudes from the bronchial resection margin and anteroinferior to. this margin there is a small firm nodule which may represent an involved lymph. node. The mediastinal pleural surface has a nodular appearance but elsewhere. the surface is smooth. Sectioning of the tumour reveals that it invades the. bronchial wall and projects within the lumen of the bronchus proximally towards. the margin. Tumour is present 11 mm from the bronchial resection margin. The. lesion measures 65 X 60 x 40 mm. The centre of the lesion is necrotic and. liquid but elsewhere the tumour has a firm variegated cut surface with areas of. cream, yellow and tan discolouration. The lesion abuts the overlying. mediastinal pleural surface. Extending from the tumour and into the lower lobe. there is an area of firm yellow discolouration which is demarcated along one. edge by interlobular septa. It extends over an area measuring 55 x 30 X 30 mm. and lies beneath the pleura along the anterior border of the lower lobe. This. area ends distally at a small 10 cm nodule which has a yellow focally. haemorrhagic cut surface. This nodule measures 12 mm in maximum extent. The. remaining lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable. [1A, bronchial, vascular. and soft tissue resection margin; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1D,. endobronchial tumour and adjacent lung; 1E-1F, tumour with overlying. mediastinal pleura; 1G, area of yellow consolidation; 1H, distal nodule; 11,. uninvolved apical lung parenchyma.]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar node"" and consists of a single fragment of. reddish black tissue which measures 24 x 15 x up to 10 mm. [Bisected, 2A.]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""No. 8 lymph node"" and consists of a single. fragment of fibrofatty tissue which measures 20 x 15 x 10 mm. Sectioning. reveals a blackened lymph node. [Bisected, 3A.]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a non-small cell carcinoma with multifocal necrosis. The. majority of the tumour comprises patternless sheets of smallish cells with. granular chromatin and somewhat fibrillar or granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Page 1 o. Histopathology Report. In a few areas there is cytoplasmic clearing. There are scattered small foci. suggestive of squamous differentiation in the form of larger cells with more. eosinophilic cytoplasm, larger more vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and. sometimes multinucleation. However there is no evidence of keratinisation and. no intercellular bridges are found. Mitoses are frequent and often abnormal. Immunoperoxidase staining for neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin,. synaptophysin and CD56) is negative. The tumour includes endobronchial and. parenchymal components. A tiny strip of metaplastic squamous epithelium. showing moderate dysplasia is noted in one large bronchus adjacent to the. tumour (1D), and several other airways within the tumour appear to show. squamous carcinoma in situ. Vascular invasion is identified (1D, 1E) and there. is invasion into, but not through, the mediastinal pleura (1E). Lymphatic. invasion is not identified but metastatic carcinoma is present in peribronchial. lymph nodes. No perineural invasion is seen. The bronchial resection margin. is clear of dysplasia and invasive malignancy, although a small amount of. largely necrotic tumour appears to lie free in the lumen. The inked. mediastinal soft tissue resection margin is also clear of malignancy. The. area. of yellowish consolidation in the lower lobe is the result of organising. obstructive pneumonitis. This shows focal cavitation resulting in the nodule. noted macroscopically, but no organisms are identified in routine or special. stains. 2 & 3: Sections of the separately submitted hilar and no. 8 lymph nodes show. reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and aggregates of pigmented histiocytes but no. evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

The specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe wedge resection' and consists of a wedge of lung tissue, 130 x. 70 X 30 mm. The specimen bears a line of staples 110 mm in length. Protruding from one aspect of. the pleural surface is a palpable mass. The pleura is free and mobile over the mass. 35 mm away from. this lesion is a firm pleural plaque, 30 mm in diameter. Elsewhere the pleura shows some irregular. grey and white discolouration. Serial slicing reveals a well defined yellowish white tumour mass, 25. mm in greatest diameter, approximately 2 mm deep to the pleura. The cut surface shows small areas of. yellowish necrosis. The tumour is at least 25 mm clear of the stapled surgical margin. No other lesions. are identified. The uninvolved lung shows severe emphysema. The mass lesion has been sampled for. Microbiology and for. [1A-1B tumour with overlying pleura; 1C-1D pleural. plaque for decalcification; 1E-1F uninvolved lung parenchyma.]. MICROSCOPY. Sections reveal a peripherally located moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma demonstrating. predominantly acinar and focal solid architecture. The tumour is positive for CK7 and TTF1 and. negative for CK20. Zones of geographic necrosis are evident within the confines of the tumour. The. tumour does not involve the pleura and is macroscopically clear of the intraparenchymal stapled. margin.

Six specimens received: 1: The specimen is unlabelled and consists of a fragment of tissue measuring 6. X 4 x 3 mm. [BIT, 1A]. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: No evidence of malignancy. Phoned to. 2: The specimen is labelled ""(R) lung' and consists of a right lung measuring. 220 mm superior to inferior, 160 mm anterior to posterior and 90 mm medial to. lateral. The upper and lower lobes are formed well. The right middle lobe is. quite rudimentary and the horizontal fissure is only very poorly formed. The. pleural surface is quite ragged particularly over the right lower lobe. A. piece of redundant pleura is present at the inferolateral aspect of this lobe. Several discrete areas of firm induration can be palpated over the medial. surface of the right lower lobe. The pleural surface of the right upper lobe. is much smoother, however the lung itself is quite firm in the inferior aspect. of the right upper lobe and a firm mass can be palpated in the right lower lobe. close to the hilar region. On sectioning of the lung the right upper lobe is. largely free of pathology. In the right lower lobe numerous perihilar lymph. nodes can be seen and a firm tumour mass measuring 43 x 25 x 20 mm. It has an. endobronchial component approaching to within 7 mm of the bronchial resection. margin and appearing to completely obstruct the right lower lobe bronchus. The. right lower lobe is nearly completely replaced by pneumonia and large amounts. of tenacious pus are noted throughout this lobe of lung.

MICROSCOPIC. 1: Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of no evidence of. malignancy. The biopsy includes bronchial cartilage and seromucinous glands. and surrounding fibroadipose tissue. 2: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that is. forming a polypoid endobronchial mass and is invading through the bronchial. wall and into the adjacent lung and hilar fibroadipose tissue. Pleural. invasion is not identified. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic. permeation is seen. Perineural permeation is identified and this extends. closely to (0.3 mm) a hilar soft tissue margin. The lesion is well clear of. the bronchial resection margin. At the bronchial resection, squamous. metaplasia is identified. There is involvement of peribronchial lymph nodes. within the region of the tumour. Distal to the tumour, there is evidence of. obstructive pneumonitis with mild bronchiectasis. The uninvolved lung shows. mild respiratory bronchiolitis, peribronchial dust deposition and emphysema. Elastic pulmonary arteries show mild atheroma. The attached pleural adhesion. appears fibrotic. Within the peribronchial lymph nodes, there are silicotic. nodules together with prominent sinus histiocytosis. Focally the histiocytes. are forming poorly developed granulomata. The granulomata may be in response. to the tumour however, a rare granuloma contains central necrosis and special. stains for micro-organisms will be undertaken. A large silicotic nodule is. present in the subpleural lymph node. 3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 4: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 6: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. 1-6: Right lung and lymph nodes: A: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 43 mm in maximal. dimension. Histopathology Report. B: Perineural permeation identified but no blood vessel or lymphatic invasion. present. C: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin but close to. hilar soft tissue margin (0.3 mm).

Submitted fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""left. upper lobe"" is a lobe of lung tissue which has been. amputated at the level of its principle bronchus and blood vessels. The bronchial profiles that are present consists of three bronchi,. each approximately 8 to 9 mm across. They are grossly unremarkable. Some vascular stumps are present at the point of amputation as well. There is some anthracotic tissue present which may represent some. hilar lymph nodes. The visceral pleural surface of the lobe is. intact although there is a small area of adhesion and thickening. overlying an obviously large intraparenchymal tumor mass. The. remainder of the parenchyma is anthracotic without focal lesion. The lung was serially sectioned and this reveals a very large tumor. mass present in the center of the lobe which has a extensively. necrotic center. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 cm. across. There is a rim of granular brown black tumor tissue present which. appears to extend to the visceral pleural surface. The center of the. tumor is necrotic with a creamy yellowish red appearance.

Tumor made up to solid structures of large atypical epithelia, densely packed in parts, with copious,. mostly stained cytoplasm with the inclusion of isolated very large, otherwise often round, occasionally. deformed nuclei containing granular chromatin and always prominent nucleoli. Apoptoses, not uncommonly. several mitoses per markedly enlarged visual field (field length 0.61 mm). Occasionally a vague epidermoid. layer, often intercellular fissures and isolated visible bridges. No mucin inclusion. In places a dissociation of the. tumor cell structures. Smaller areas of necrosis. Affected lung parenchyma partly destroyed, likewise a. relatively a large bronchus here, strand of cartilage remaining. A further large bronchus partially infiltrated and. involved in the tumor, likewise in this area smaller bronchi and bronchioles whose lumen is partly dilated, the. original respiratory epithelium replaced by tumor epithelium. In adjacent region tumor cell nests and formations. of small tumor lie freely in alveoli, also tumor cell structures in dilated lymph vessels. Vascularized interlobular. septa. between the tumor formations partly loose, partly fiber-rich, collagenous connective tissue with. accumulation of inflammatory cells. Isolated small vessels here, walls thickened by elastosis and containing. tumor cells. A larger vein surrounded, loose capillary-containing fiber tissue in the lumen.

Lower pleural fissure and partly fused visceral pleura demarcating or. covering this fissure transcended by tumor, where large bronchi are invaded to within close proximity of the. mucosa. Large tumor node next to the upper lobe bronchus bifurcation, enclosed anthracotic pigment, tumor. cell nests here at the resection margin. In the mediastinal tissue a further tumor-compromised lymph node with. anthracotic pigment deposits and otherwise fibrous growth of connective tissue. In subpleural region of S1 a flat. remodeling zone of the lung parenchyma with development of collagenous and elastic connective tissue, with. alveolar stroma still partly recognizable. Nearby tiny radial areas of interstitial fibrosis with small patches. of. accumulated anthracotic pigment. In the basal lower lobe am relatively large area of nonoxygenated, fibrosed. lung parenchyma with inclusion of partly obliterated smaller, partly patent vessels and bronchioles. Overlying. pleura markedly enlarged and fibrotic. Otherwise here and there in dilated peripheral airways mucus and. leukocytes and also a small cluster of pigment-storing macrophages in the alveoli. At the bronchus resection. margin, sections of mucosal epithelium are interrupted, otherwise regular. Here as in the walls of the large. pulmonary vessels no evidence of tumor cells. Lymph node at the hilus with isolated secondary follicles, slight. plaque of anthracotic pigment and foci of large macrophages. Re 2.) - b.) Partly preserved lymph nodes with few secondary follicles, varying degrees of anthracotic pigment. deposits, accumulation of macrophages and isolated secondary follicles. In parts, lymph nodes are largely. occupied by solid epithelial tumor. In places, tumor manifestation also in the paranodal tissue. At one point and. in a larger lymph node only very small areas occupied by tumor cell nests. EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Central bronchopulmonary, histologically largely undifferentiated, large-cell squamous cell carcinoma of the. right lower lobe of the lung (C4) with overgrowth of the interlobar fissure and continuous growth into the. adjacent section of the middle lobe and also several in some cases large lymph node metastases. Tumor. classification according to this picture pT2 pN3 L1 V1 R1, stage III. C34.3 M8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Peripheral bronchiolectasia in the lower lobe, relatively large fibrous cicatricial remodeling zone in S10. mediobasal and similar flat subpleural cicatricial zones in S1 apical. Local high-grade pleural fibrosis over S10. Tumor-associated inflammation and small tumor necroses. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung. parenchyma and relatively marked in some lymph nodes. Remark/addendum: The main mass of the carcínoma lies in S10. Centrally it has grown as far as the bifurcations of the lower lobe. main bronchus and the middle lobe bronchus, without these being destroyed or constricted. The tumor invasion. of small blood vessels only concerns the focal region, the lymphangioinvasion is more marked and is also. located in the vicinity of the tumor focus. The R1 classification is based on the finding that carcinoma nests in. the large involved lymph nodes next to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus extend to the mediastinal. resection plane. Further lymph node metastases are seen at the intermediate bronchus in the mediastinum and. also in the lymph nodes located under 4.) - 6.). The pN3 classification is also made with regard to the previous. finding with carcinoma cell structures in the fine needle aspiration biopsy from LN4 left (according to clinical. data).",0.15,0

TCGA-05-4396,"Main diagnosis/diagnoses: Very extensive, pneumonia-like, imposing bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with a. predominantly tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern, as well as slight mucin. formation and formation of numerous, in parts very small foci within the parenchyma and. minimal pleural invasion and lymphogenous metastatic spread. Comment/supplementary remark: By definition, the foci of mixed adenocarcinoma detected not only in the immediate. environment of the tumor, but in some cases only at microscopic level, are to be classified. satellite nodes in the lipsilateral lobe, which - bearing in mind the location of the lymph node. micrometastases (samples 5.), 7.) and very probably also 1.)), as well as the absence of tumor. in the resection margins of the bronchus and the vessels - gives a tumor classification of pT4. pN1 R0. But in view of the presentation of the tumor and the partial bronchioloalveolar. differentiation, the interpretation can be just as easily be supported or perhaps even favored. that this is a primary multifocal tumor manifestation. This would correspond to pT2(m). The. stage grouping IIIB thus competes with IIB. The main tumor mass lies in segments 6 and 9 of. the resected right lower lobe.

Clinical Notes: male with SCC left upper lobe bronchus. ? involvement of superior pulmonary vein into left atrium. ? free margin. Five specimens are received: 1: LEFT LUNG. Macroscopy: Specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and consists of a left lung measuring 255 x. 180 X approximately 65 mm. There is approximately 28 mm of left main bronchus. attached to the specimen. The pleural surface is puckered over the lower. lateral aspect of the upper lobe. In addition there are bullae present at the. apex of the upper lobe ranging in size from 3-20 mm. The pleural surface is. also puckered on the medial surface of the upper lobe immediately anterior to. the hilum. On sectioning through the lung parenchyma, there is a large lesion. present, which arises from the left upper lobe bronchus approximately 50 mm. from the bronchial resection margin. The lesion measures approximately 65 x 50. x 50 mm. The tumour lies immediately deep to the hilum but extends through the. lung parenchyma to lie beneath the puckered pleural surface on the lateral. aspect of the lung. The tumour appears to involve predominantly the upper lobe. but also involves the upper portion of the lower lobe. There is an area of. cavitation present within the tumour measuring approximately 25 mm in diameter,. Tumour macroscopically involves the pulmonary vein and appears to come to. within 1 mm of the resection margin of the specimen. Tumour appears to. directly invade several parabronchial lymph nodes.

EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of. s and up to 40% in the. population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable. clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small. cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sample Preparation and Gene Sequencing Analysis. For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, manual microdissection was. performed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor calls in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using. standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of mutation, DNA was amplified with primers for the. KRAS gene and exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. Then. forward and reverse sequencing was performed using the. on. AB/3130. ). The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations with Mutation Surveyor V3.07. For. specimens with low quality and quantity of DNA, an alternative method (real-time PCR on LightCycler (Roche)) was applied for detection of KRAS. mutations. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: In Situ Procedure. Interpretation. PROBE: Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/ CEP 7 SpectrumGreer TM Probe. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 2.65 indicating EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 25.8%, and the monosomy rate was 36.4% in the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the. EGFR gene was 5.7. 66 cells were analyzed In the targeted region. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2,0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification.

Specimen received in fresh for frozen section labeled as ""right. upper lobe-check bronchial margin"" consists of lobe of the lung. weighing 270 grams and measuring 18 x 8 x 5 cm. Bronchial margin is. processed for frozen section. After initial fixation the specimen is re-examined. The maximal. diameter of the tumor is 7.7 cm and is immediately beneath a. puckered but. apparently intact overlying pleural surface that is opposite this. side of the bronchial resection margin. The distance from the. bronchial resection margin to the nearest portion of the tumor is. about 1 cm. On cut surface, the tumor is mostly pale white, flecked. with gray and black with some mucoid material and foci of necrosis. Multiple staple lines are present pulling together portions of the. pleura along the resection margin of the hilum and adjacent tissues. On further inspection, some of the tumor appears to come very close. to the stapled margins in the area of the hilar portion and such. areas are marked with blue dye to aid in identification in sections. I do not see tumor actually reaching the surface, but it may be very. near. All staple lines are trimmed and the closest soft tissue. margin, which is very near the bronchial resection margin is sampled. as two pieces in block A2 which represent also tumor that is closest. to the bronchial resection margin. Possible bronchial lymph nodes. are taken in block A3. Additional major bronchi and blood vessels. near the margin are taken in block A4. Neoplasm nearest the. bronchial end is taken as blocks A5 and A6. The neoplasm just. beneath the puckered area of the pleura is taken in blocks A7 and. A8. Additional neoplasm is taken in blocks A8 and A9, including. areas of overlying pleura. Uninvolved portions of the lung appear. emphysematous are taken in blocks All and A12. In summary, this is a large neoplasm in the long occupying a large. portion of tissue removed with tumor growing just beneath or perhaps. into the pleura, but not apparently going through it. At the hilar. aspect tumor comes very close to some of the soft tissue margins,. but we know the bronchial resection margin is negative. Also,. available peribronchial lymph nodes are small, but dark and are not. grossly involved. B. ""Lymph node #10. "" Multiple pieces of pale tan to off-white and. focally red-brown tissues range from 4-10 mm across. C. ""Lymph node #7. Multiple pieces of brown-black lymph node. tissue range from 6-12 mm across.

Received in formalin labeled-. and right lower lobe, is a 239 gm, 15.8 x 10,5 x 4.3 cm, lung lobe with a 0.4 cm segment of attached. bronchial. The specimen cannot be oriented. The pleura is shaggy and tan-red to gray-purple with three linear staple lines near the hilum, ranging from 3.1 cm to 5.5 cm. The staple lines are. removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked blue. The cut surface consists of a 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm, ill-defined tan mass, 1.6 cm from the pleura. The mass is 2.6 cm from the bronchial margin and 4.1 cm. from the closest staple line. The remainder of the cut surface consists of spongy red-brown parenchyma. No additional lesions are identified. No obvious intraparenchymal lymph. nodes are identified. There are four irregular gray-black firm tissues consistent with probable lymph node at the hilum, ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 X 0.2 cm to 0.8 x 0.5 X 0.3 cm. The specimen is inked, serially sectioned, and representative sections are submitted as labeled: 1 -- bronchial vascular margins (en face); 2 -- mass to. pleura; 3-5 -- remainder of identifiable mass, entirely suhmittedi a a - uninvolved parenchyma to include stapled areas (perpendicular); 9 -- four whole. hilar probable lymph nodes.

TCGA-78-7149,"HISTORY. RLL lesion. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens submitted. 1: The first specimen is labelled ""right lower lobectomy"" and consists of a right lower lobectomy. specimen which measures 70 X 80 X 60 mm. Sectioning reveals a large tumour present predominantly. in the superior aspect of the lobe which measures 75 X 60 X 60 mm. The tumour has a pink and tan. colour and has a soft consistency. The tumour reaches the pleura but no definite invasion through the. pleura is seen grossly. The tumour extensively invades around bronchi and at one point tumour is seen. to erode through the bronchial wall to form a polypoid mass measuring up to 10 mm within the. bronchial lumen. This is present approximately 14 mm away from the nearest bronchial resection. margin. The tumour appears to come within approximately 2 mm of the hilar resection margin but. tumour is not seen at a surgical resection margin. Located away from the main tumour within the. inferomedial aspect of the lung are three separate tumour nodules measuring between 5 to 12 mm in. diameter. An area of fibrosis and calcification measuring up to 3 mm in diameter is also seen within. the region of one of the separate tumour nodules in the inferior aspect of the lobe. Lung tissue at the. superior aspect of the lobe proximal to the tumour shows yellow discolouration. The lung in the. inferior aspect of the lobe distal to the tumour appears fairly unremarkable. [1A, bronchial and hilar. vascular resection margins; 1B, vascular resection margin and lymph nodes; 1C-1G, tumour with 1D. being mediastinal resection margin, 1E bronchus with invasion by tumour; 1G-1I, separate tumour. deposits inferior to the main tumour; 1J, uninvolved lung proximal to tumour; 1K, uninvolved lung. distal to tumour.]. 2: The second specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of multiple fragments of grey. tissue measuring in aggregate approximately 20 X 20 X 5 mm. [BIT, 2A.]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Much of the tumour has the. cytoarchitectural features of a non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, but unequivocal stromal. invasion is present, and an endobronchial component is confirmed. Tumour abuts but does not invade. the pleura, and the bronchial and mediastinal resection margins are clear of malignancy. No vascular. or lymphatic invasion is identified. Peribronchial lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic. adenocarcinoma. Several satellite nodules are confirmed in lung parenchyma inferior to the main. tumour mass. These show the BAC architecture and presumably represent spread through airways. 2: Sections show fragments of lymph node in which there is no evidence of metastatic. adenocarcinoma. SUMMARY. Right lower lobectomy: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a large component of. bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, 75 mm in diameter, with adjacent satellite nodules.

Cells with the ROS translocation show one pair of signals (green and red) in juxtaposition and one green and one red signal. separated. ROS FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the ROS. Texas Red (centromeric) and the ROS FITC(telomeric) probes. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Molecular Anatomic Pathology Procedure. Interpretation. MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING: Block 15C: A. KRAS codon 12 mutation IDENTIFIED (p.G12C, c.34G>T). B. KRAS codon 61 mutation NOT identified. C. EGFR exon 18 mutation NOT identified. D. EGFR exon 19 mutation NOT identified. E. EGFR exon 20 mutation NOT identified. F. EGFR exon 21 mutation NOT identified. G. BRAF codon 600 mutation NOT identified. NOTE: The quantity and quality of isolated DNA was acceptable for testing. BACKGROUND: EGFR mutations are present in about 10-15% of non-Asian and up to 40% of the Asian patients with non-small-cell lung. cancer (NSCLC) (1,2). They are more frequent in non-smokers, females, and in tumors with adenocarcinoma histology. Activating EGFR mutations including exon 19 deletions, exon 21 point mutations (L858R, L861Q), and exon 18 G719A/C/S. point mutation are associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (gefitinib,. erlotinib) (2-4). Advanced NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations show response rates of more than 70%, with. progression-free survival up to 14 month (2,3). However, EGFR mutations in exon 20 (insertions and T790M point. mutation) are associated with acquired resistance to TKIs (4). KRAS mutations and BRAF mutations are found in. approximately 30% and 2% of lung adenocarcinomas respectively. The most common mutation types are KRAS codon. 12/13 and BRAF V600E. Patients with these mutations tend to be resistant to erlotinib and gefitinib (2,5,6). However,. not all tumors reveal such a correlation and, therefore, the results of molecular testing should be interpreted in. conjunction with other laboratory and cilnical findings. MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, manual microdissection was. performed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target or more than 300 cells for FNA specimen were. accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of. mutation, DNA was amplified with primers for the exons 2 and 3 of the KRAS gene and exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. Then, forward and. reverse sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on ABI3130. The sequencing electropherograms were. analyzed for the presence of mutations. The method sensitivity is approximately 20% of mutant alleles in a background of normal DNA. For. detection of BRAF mutation, real-time PCR was performed on the LightCycler platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601 sequences. Post-PCR. melting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR. product on ABI3130. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal DNA. In Situ Procedure. Interpretation. PROBE: LSI ALK Dual-Color Break-apart Probe 2p23.

TCGA-77-8130,"Histopathology Report. LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY AND HILAR LYMPH NODES. Clinical Details: None supplied. Two specimens submitted: 1: LEFT UPPER LOBE. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a lobectomy specimen weighing 419 g in the fixed state. and measuring 170 x 115 x 65 mm. The pleural surface is mostly smooth, however. there is an area of roughening on the lower medial surface measuring. approximately 25 X 20 mm. In addition, adjacent to the hilum, there is a small. piece of adherent pleura measuring 30 x 20 mm. On sectioning there is a large. tumour present centrally within the lobe measuring 45 x 35 x 35 mm. This. lesion invades the main lobar bronchus and extends to within approximately 11. mm of the bronchial resection margin. The resection margin does appear clear. of tumour. The bronchus is almost completely occluded by tumour and distal. bronchi show marked mucus plugging. Tumour appears to abut the medial pleural. surface in several areas. There does not appear to be tumour extending through. the pleural surface. Elsewhere the lung parenchyma shows anthracosis and. emphysema, the latter of which is more prominent towards the apices. The. lingula is markedly congested. No further mass lesions are noted. Macroscopically tumour appears to involve at least some of the peribronchial. lymph nodes. [Sections taken through bronchial resection margins, A-B;. parabronchial lymph node bisected, C; tumour invading bronchus, D-F (E and F. represent a single slice bisected); tumour with overlying pleural surface, G-I;. tumour and adjacent lung, J; random section from apex, K; and lingula, L]. Microscopy: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma arising from a. large bronchus and directly invading the adjacent pulmonary artery. This. vessel is largely occluded, and numerous smaller branches distal to the main. vessel are also obliterated by tumour. The tumour itself shows very extensive. central necrosis. Tumour directly invades peribronchial lymph nodes. There. is. also invasion of pleura on the medial aspect of the lung. The bronchial. resection margin is clear of malignancy but shows extensive squamous metaplasia. and mild dysplasia. No lymphatic, venous or perineural infiltration is. identified. Lung parenchyma distal to the tumour is confirmed to show. bronchiectasis and mucus plugging. There is also emphysema but there is no. evidence of active inflammation. Tissue from the lingula shows focal. infarction. Conclusion: Page 1c. Histopathology Report. Left upper lobectomy: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 45 mm in. maximum diameter, invading pleura and pulmonary artery; pathological stage T2. N1. 2: HILAR LYMPH NODES. Macroscopy: The specimen consists of multiple fragments of dark tan tissue measuring in. aggregate 30 x 25 X 3 mm. [The majority of the tissue is BIT, 2A]. Microscopy: Sections show multiple fragments of lymph node in which there are reactive. changes but no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

This mutation is. reported to correlate with RESPONSIVENESS to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small- -. cell lung cancer. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal. growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be. associated with differential responsiveness/resistance to. targeted therapeutics for non-small-cell lung cancer. (NSCLC) . Most data published pertain to Gefitinib. Similar. data have been seen in studies using Erlotinib. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical significance and utility of this test in other. tumor types is unknown. Method: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR. tyrosine kinase domain. Based on current literature, the vast. majority of mutations are expected to occur in these exons. Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant. tumor is selected for analysis. DNA is extracted from the. tissue and subject to PCR amplification using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. The amplification products. are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA. sequencing using capillary gel electrophoresis and. fluorescence detection. The analytical sensitivity of the. assay is 20% mutant alleles, or 40% tumor cells with a. heterozygous mutation; mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected.

Squamous cell cancer. GROSS. A. Labeled ""right lower lobe frozen"" is a resected right lower lobe. of pink-tan rubbery lung, 16.2 x 12.8 x 5.2 cm and 290 grams. There. are multiple linear staple lines in the hilar area and one at the. apex. Bronchial resection margin is taken for frozen section. examination (FSA1). Vessel resection margins in this area are submitted in block 4. Two. centimeters from the bronchial resection margin, there is a 3.1 x. 2.- x 1.5 cm firm tan, partially necrotic tumor mass of the. anteromedial segment, which encases and apparently obstructs the. bronchus, as distal bronchi exude white pus-like material. A tumor. appears to extend up to the large vessel wall, which is not. occluded, and to involve adjacent peribronchial lymph node (blocks. 5-7) . Overlying pleura in this area is not grossly involved, but. ragged and with staple lines impeding evaluation (block 8). Three. black peribronchial lymph nodes contiguous with the mass appear. partially involved by tumor and range from 0.6 to 1.2 cm in greatest. dimension each (block 9-11, one node each) . A separate firm tan tumor mass involving the apex of the superior. segment, is 3.5 cm away from the bronchial resection margin and 2.5. cm from the hilar tumor. It is ovoid, 4.2 x 2 x 2.6 cm, firm,. tan-white and with elevated, well-defined margins. The tumor. appears to involve disrupted parenchyma beneath the suture line in. this area (frozen sections A2 and A3) . According to the surgeon,. this area corresponds to the area of lung parenchyma submitted for. frozen section examination with surface inked black. Apex tumor. blocks 12 and 13. Parenchyma away from these lesions displays. dilated bronchi, though many filled with pus and tan-pink parenchyma. without additional nodules (block 13) A portion of both tumors is. submitted as separate specimens for the. B. Labeled ""right middle lobe wedge, check area with stitch"" is a. 7.8 x 7.5 x 2.5 cm and 78 gram wedge of purple-tan lung with. generally smooth pleural surface and a Y-shaped heavy staple line. along one aspect. A stitch in the staple line denotes the area of. special attention, which is the bronchial margin and submitted for. frozen section evaluation. Next, additional section of this margin. is taken as block 2. According to the surgeon, this area. corresponds to the area of gross tumor at the apex of specimen ""A.'. No gross tumor is seen in this area or elsewhere within the rubbery. purple-tan parenchyma. Bronchi are opened and free of lesion. C. ""L9 lymph node.

Tumor 2. cm from bronchial resection margin. Diagnosis to Dr. A2. Parenchymal margin of apex tumor: Positive for carcinoma. B. Right middle lobectomy: Bronchial resection margin, negative for carcinoma. MICROSCOPIC. A. The frozen section control block confirms the frozen section. findings of a negative bronchial resection margin. The frozen. section control of the apex tumor confirms that is a nonsmall cell. carcinoma of high grade with foci of necrosis and apparent extensive. invasion of vascular channels, probably lymphatics. As noted grossly the large vein near the hilum and has infiltrating. carcinoma in its wall and the associated artery is negative. The. lymph node that is grossly involved near the hilum contains. metastatic high-grade carcinoma. The tumor focally has squamous. features and I do not see any small cell carcinoma, but part of the. larger tumor by the hilum does have some smaller cell size, but. appears to be a less mature form of squamous cell carcinoma. The. tumor in blocks 12 and 13 from the apex has larger cells and more. glassy cytoplasm and on H and E a question of additional. adenocarcinoma is raised. Out of all sampled lymph nodes we have four of six positive lymph. nodes. The tumor grows immediately beneath the pleural surface, but. does not present to the outer surface. Focal invasion into the. pleura is noted. Due to the multiple histologic morphologic variations in the tumors,. selected blocks A7 and A13 from the hilar and apical foci are. selected, respectively, for additional immunostains. P63 and CK 5,. squamous markers, are strongly positive in both tumor nodules. TTF-1, a good marker for adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinoma is. negative except for a few scattered cells. The stains were prepared. at. and the controls work. These results indicate. squamous cell carcínoma throughout both tumor nodules. B. The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings. of a bronchial resection margin negative for tumor. Additional. tissue from this specimen is processed and all is negative for. invasive tumor. C. The lymph node is negative for tumor. D. The lymph node is reactive but is negative for metastatic. tumor. E. The lymph node is enlarged but is reactive, negative for. metastatic disease. DIAGNOSIS. A.

Macroscopy: Specimen is labelled ""wedge resection L lower lobe"" and consists of a piece of. lung measuring 65 X 70 X 63 mm in the inflated state. The pleural surface. appears normal. Sectioning the specimen reveals a cream coloured well. circumscribed mass measuring 32 mm in maximal dimension. It is located at. least 10 mm from the wedge resection margin. The mass abuts the pleura but. does not definitely invade it. The adjacent lung shows some subpleural. fibrosis and cyst formation. [RS of tumour, 1A-1D; sections of cyst formation. and probable fibrosis, E and F]. Microscopy: Sections show a well-differentiated to moderately-differentiated keratinising. squamous cell carcinoma. There is extensive central necrosis, probably as a. result of arterial invasion which is evident in several large pulmonary artery. branches. Tumour abuts, but does not invade, the pleura. Foci suspicious for. lymphatic permeation are noted. Resection margins are well clear of. malignancy. No lymph nodes are included. Sections of the adjacent lung tissue show a temporally and spatially. heterogeneous inflammatory and fibrosing process located in subpleural. parenchyma only. Here there is established honeycombing together with foci of. interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and fibrous widening of alveolar septa. Fibroblastic foci are identified and there is some smooth muscle proliferation. There is no evidence of overlying pleuritis. A focus of organising pneumonia. is noted in a more central parenchymal area.

NOTE: The quantity and quality of isolated DNA was acceptable for testing. BACKGROUND: EGFR mutations are present in about 10-15% of non-Asian and up to 40% of the Asian patients with non-small-cell lung. cancer (NSCLC) (1,2). They are more frequent in non-smokers, females, and in tumors with adenocarcinoma. histology. Activating EGFR mutations including exon 19 deletions, exon 21 point mutations (L858R, L861Q), and exon 18 G719A/C/S. point mutation are associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (gefitinib,. erlotinib) (2-4). Advanced NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations show response rates of more than. 70%,. with. progression-free survival up to 14 month (2,3). However, EGFR mutations in exon 20 (insertions and T790M point. mutation) are associated with acquired resistance to TKIs (4). KRAS mutations and BRAF mutations are found in. approximately 30% and 2% of lung adenocarcinomas respectively. The most common mutation types are KRAS codon. 12/13 and BRAF V600E. Patients with these mutations tend to be resistant to erlotinib and gefitlnib (2,5,6). However,. not all tumors reveal such a correlation and, therefore, the results of molecular testing should be interpreted in. conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings. MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens, manual microdissection was. performed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target or more than 300 cells for FNA specimen were. accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the. detection of. mutation, DNA was amplified with primers for the exons 2 and 3 of the KRAS gene and exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. Then,. forward. and. reverse sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on ABI3130. The sequencing electropherograms were. analyzed for the presence of mutations. The method sensitivity is approximately 20% of mutant alleles in a background of. normal. DNA. For. detection of BRAF mutation, real-time PCR was performed on the LightCycler platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601 sequences. Post-PCR. melting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by. sequencing of the PCR. product on ABI3130. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal DNA. nesuits. ALK translocation is detected as follows: ALK negative: 0-15% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement. Normal cells without the ALK translocation show green and orange signals in juxtaposition. ALK positive: Greater than 15% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement. Cells with the ALK translocation show one of the following patterns: One pair of signals (green and orange) fused or in juxtaposition. and one green and one orange signal separated; Only split O & G (single o and single G in the same nucleus); Only single O;. Fusion + single O. c-MET amplification is detected as follows: RP11-163C9,. c-MET FISH positive: Gene Amplification: Ratio gene/chromosome more than two. c-MET FISH negative: Ratio gene/chromosome less than two. FGFR1(Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1) is a protein coding gene whose largest transcript features 18 exons, measures 5.6. kb and is located on chromosome 8p11.2.The FGFR1 probe mix consists of a green 154kb probe telomeric to the FGFR1 gene. spanning the LETM2-202 gene and D8S135 marker. The red probe is 52kb centromeric to the FGFR1 gene spanning a. 108kb. region including the D8S389 marker. FGFR1 FISH positive: Gene Amplification: Ratio gene/chromosome more than two. FGFR1 FISH negative: Ratio gene/chromosome less than two.",0.85,1
TCGA-55-5899,"FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: Lung, right upper lobe, biopsies: Adenocarcinoma - see comment. COMMENTS: Histologic sections show an invasive carcinoma consisting. primarily of sheets of cells with scattered, discrete. glandular structures. The neoplastic cells have prominent. nucleoli, and do not have the cytologic appearance of small. cell carcinoma, grade Il neuroendocrine carcinoma (atypical. carcinoid) or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are performed. The neoplasm. stains positively for cytokeratin CK7 as well as for TTF-1. The neoplasm is negative for CK20, high molecular weight. keratin SK and p63. The findings support the diagnosis of. adenocarcinoma of lung primary. There is weak staining for. synaptophysin. It is felt in that this is an example of. non-neuroendocrine carcinoma (adenocarcinoma) that shows. positive staining for synaptophysin, and that it should not. result in classification of a neuroendocrine tumor. Current NCCN practice guidelines recommend determination of. EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to. help select patients for Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been shown to be. significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are. mutually exclusive in NSCLC. Additionally, recent data show. that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene rearrangements in. adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to. TKIs and have favorable response rates to Crizotinib, the. ALK inhibitor agent currently in clinical trials. Mutation. analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene. rearrangement by FISH is available as the Lung Cancer. Mutation Panel. Testing may be performed on. paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic. tumor or pleural fluid cell block. These tests are. available on request as a panel or as individual assays.

EML4/ALK rearrangement NOT identified (see In Situ Procedu. Note: KRAS codon 12/13 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of. smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian. population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable. clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small. cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in. chromosome 2p resulting in the EML4/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence. of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying. patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EML4/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with. KRAS and EGFR mutations. Addendum. Sections of the Part 2 ""portion of fifth rib"" show normal bone and bone marrow with trilineage representation and maturation.

Permanent sections of this bronchial margin do show adenocarcinoma within the adventitial. cuff of the bronchus. While present in these permanent sections, the margin of resection is interpreted as negative but it. should be noted that carcinoma extends within 1-2 mm of this final margin.

The specimen is labeled left lung and is received without fixative. It consists of a left pneumonectomy. specimen with an approximate weight of 550 grams. The left upper lobe measures 18.5 X 7.8 X 5.5 cm. and the left lower lobe measures 23.5 x 10.5 x 9 cm. The pleural surfaces of both lobes vary from tan to. pale red to violet and there is prominent anthracotic mottling along the anterior and lateral surface. At the. hilum, there is a 2.5 cm segment of mainstem bronchus. There are a few small gray-brown to black. bronchohilar nodes. In the mid anterior surface of the upper lobe, directly opposite the mainstem. bronchus, there is an area of puckering and folding of the pleural surface approximately 3 cm in maximum. dimension. The pleural surface in this area is inked. There is palpable firmness of the lung parenchyma. in. the peribronchial area. Metallic staple lines are present in the interlobar fissure between the upper and. lower lobe directly opposite the mainstem bronchus. On sectioning, the pleural parenchyma surrounding. the upper lobe segmental bronchus is firm, pale yellow to gray-tan with inspissated mucoid material. throughout the pulmonary parenchyma. This firm tissue overall measures 4.5 x 3x3.3 cm and on. superficial dissection, this tissue approaches to within 2.5 cm of the bronchial resection margin. It. approaches to within 0.5 cm of the vascular margins of the pneumonectomy specimen Sections. of. the. upper lobe reveal spongy, red pulmonary parenchyma in the apical portion of the lung and pink to pale. red, well-aerated pulmonary parenchyma in the inferior portion of the upper lobe. Dissection of the lower. lobe reveals no grossly obvious tumor involvement of either the lobar bronchus and surrounding. pulmonary parenchyma or the remainder of the lower lobe. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1) bronchial resection margin, A2) vascular resection margins, A3) bronchohilar lymph. nodes, A4) central medial pleural surface, A5) section of mass with closest approach to bronchial resection. margin, A6-A7) additional sections of mass, A8) peribronchial nodes, A9) uninvolved upper lobe, A10). peribronchial tissue lower lobe, A11) sections of lower lobe.

Clinical History/Operative Dx: Lung cancer. Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled right upper lobe lung and is received without fixative. It consists of a. lobectomy of lung weighing 163 grams. The lobe measures 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. Just superior to the hilum. of this lobectomy specimen, there is a wedge resection of additional lung suggestive of apical portion of. right lower lobe. This adherent wedge resection measures 8 X 2.5 X 2 cm. The pleural surface of the. upper lobe varies from tan to violet and appears smooth with very little anthracotic stippling. Where the. lung wedge is adherent to the mid portion of the upper lobe, there is palpable firmness and slight. retraction of the pulmonary parenchyma. The wedge resection is similarly adherent to the pleural surface. of the lower portion of the upper lobe. A metallic staple line runs from the hilum of the lung along the. inferior edge of the upper lobe and is 11 cm in length. The pleural surface overlying the adherent lung. wedge and in the vicinity of the palpable firmness is inked blue. The staple line along the lung wedge is. dissected free and the resection edge is inked green. On sectioning of this area of palpable firmness,. there is a relatively well-circumscribed tan to pale yellow neoplasm which overall measures 3.5 x 3.5 X. 2.9 cm. This neoplasm abuts the pleural surface of the upper lobe and passes across the interlobar fissure. between the upper lobe and the apical portion of the lower lobe, to involve the adherent wedge resection. This neoplasm is 0.5 cm from the closest bronchial margin, abuts the pleural surface in several areas, and. is 0.4 cm from the stapled resection margin of the apical portion of the lower lobe. Sections of the. remaining lung reveal pale red pulmonary parenchyma which appears relatively well-aerated. At the. hilum of the lung, there are two 0.5-0.7 cm peribronchial dull red nodes. Dissection of the major bronchi. reveal no intrabronchial tumor. The neoplasm is 6 cm or greater from the inferior staple line. Representative neoplasm is obtained in its fresh state for research purposes. Following fixation,. representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1) bronchial resection margins, A2) vascular. margins, A3) peribronchial nodes, A4-A5) tumor and pleural surface of upper lobe, A6) additional section. of tumor and upper lobe, A7-A8) full longitudinal cross-section extending from upper lobe into adherent. lower lobe wedge, including wedge resection margin, A9) tumor adjacent to upper lobe segmental. bronchus, A10) sections of upper lobe parenchyma away from tumor, A11) sections of wedge of lower. lobe away from tumor, A12) sections of inferior upper lobe along staple line.

Four specimens received: 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and consists of a left pneumonectomy specimen which. measures 180 x 150 x 40 mm. Located in the apex of the left lower lobe is a large peripheral tumour. measuring 70 X 65 x 45 mm. There is some puckering of the overlying pleura above the tumour but. definite invasion to the pleura cannot be identified grossly. Many enlarged hilar lymph nodes and. intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified but none of these show macroscopic evidence of tumour. involvement. Elsewhere the visceral pleura and parenchyma show prominent carbon pigmentation. The visceral pleura at the apex of the left upper lobe shows a cream papule. No other lesions are. identified grossly.

[Bisected, blocked with smaller. fragment, 3A.]. 4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""lymph node No. 8"" and consists of two fragments of nodal tissue,. the largest measuring approximately 10 mm in diameter. The other fragment appears to contain. multiple nodes on sectioning. [Each fragment bisected, BIT, 4A-4B.]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which abuts but does not. invade the pleura. There are extensive areas of tumour necrosis and several blood vessels within the. tumour are obliterated but definite vascular invasion is not found. No lymphatic or perineural. infiltration is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive hyperplasia, anthracosis and a few small. silicotic nodules but definite tumour metastases are not found. However metastatic carcinoma is. present within intraparenchymal lymph nodes from the left lower lobe (1J). A single fragment sampled. as a peribronchial lymph node appears to represent a fragment of the primary tumour (1D). Lung. parenchyma away from the tumour shows a marked degree of peribronchial and interlobular septal. anthracosis. There is also upper lobe emphysema and pleural fibrosis. 2: Sections show a small lymph node in which there is no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections show partial replacement of the lymph node by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 4: Sections show reactive lymph nodes with anthracosis and occasional silicotic nodules. There is no. evidence of metastatic carcinoma. SUMMARY. Left pneumonectomy and lymph node sampling: Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 70 mm in diameter.

The mass is 1 cm. from the bronchial margin. The remaining specimen shows tan-pink spongy. pulmonary parenchyma with focal congestion. No sac-like lesion is. identified. The bronchial and vascular margins are unremarkable. Three hilar. lymph nodes, ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension, are. identified. Sections show moderate anthracosis. Representative sections are. submitted in nine cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - bronchus at the frozen. section piece; cassette 2 - vascular margin; cassette 3 - three hilar lymph. nodes; cassette 4 - adherent portion with staple line; cassettes 5 through 7. mass: cassettes 8 and 9 - lung parenchyma away from the mass. The specimen consists of two pieces of tan-white soft tissue, measuring. 0.8 X 0.5 X 0.2 cm and 1.5 X 0.5 X 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted intact. in one cassette. Not for Permanent Storage in Medical Records / Not Valid for Signing. MICROSCOPIO DESCRIPTION: Nine slides are examined. The bronchial margin appears on cassette 1 and. does not show any evidence of involvement by tumor. Portions of vascular. margin appear on cassette 2 without evidence of tumor involvement. Three. hilar lymph nodes are present on slide 3. All of them show extensive. replacement by non-oat cell carcinoma. Portions of lung mass are seen on. slides 4 through 7. The tumor demonstrates extensive necrosis on slide 4, and. the remaining pattern is that of a moderately to poorly differentiated. carcinoma with numerous areas showing clear cells along with typical malignant. glands. There is extensive intrapulmonary lymphatic and vascular invasion. Pleural lymphatics on slide 4 are filled with plugs of tumor and both veins. and lymphatics of the interlobular septum show tumor involvement on the same. slide. Extensive involvement of the visceral pleura is also noted on slide. 5. On slide 6, there is a foca area showing dyskeratotic cells consistent. with squamous differentiation. Focal areas of bronchioalveolar. differentiation are noted on slide 6. On slide 7, small areas of vascular. involvement are present with plugs of tumor present in endothelial lined. spaces. On slide 8, which is said to represent lung tissue taken away from. the tumor there appears to be a minute independent focus of poorly. differentiated adenocarcinoma. One slide is examined. A portion of bronchial wall with cartilage is. present. No tumor is seen. This supports the frozen section diagnosis. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A. 1.

TCGA-50-5931,"Addendum. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization studies have been performed on the adenocarcinoma. The ratio of Her2/Neu gene to the. centromere of chromosome 17 is 2.19, indicating amplification. The ratio of cyclin D1 gene to the centromere of. chromosome 11 is 2.10, also indicating amplification in the targeted region. The ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 is 1.03, indicating a lack of amplification in this area. Her2/neu and Cyclin D1 amplification may help in identifying those patients likely to experience shorter survival when. considered together with other major risk factors. Addendum. Special stains were ordered for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and mucin to further characterize the tumor and to rule out. the possibility of a neuroendocrine origin for the tumor. Chromogranin and synaptophysin stains were negative, consistent with the previous diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma. Although the tumor shows clear evidence of gland formation, the mucin stain was negative, which is occasionally seen in. more poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. These results do NOT change the previously rendered diagnosis of a moderately to poorly differentiated. adenocarcinoma. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: SUMMARY STATEMENT. This lobectomy specimen from ""left upper lobe of lung"" demonstrates a moderate to poorly differentiated. adenocarcinoma (3.3 cm.). The tumor has neuroendocrine features.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. for patient ,. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 2D appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12S (c.34G>A) mutation in codon 12. of the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION. Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor. prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: Addendum #2 performed by.",0.3,0

TCGA-55-7913,"LUNG CANCER MUTATION PANEL. SPECIMEN SOURCE: LEFT LOWER LOBE LUNG. SPECIMEN/BLOCK NUMBER. EGFR Mutation: NOT DETECTED. This result was reviewed and interpreted by. The following polymorphism was detected: 2361g>A. Sequencing of the entire coding region and splice junction sites of exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene revealed no previously published mutations or any. sequence changes that could result in amino acid changes. However, one or more polymorphic sequence changes were discovered in the EGFR gene. These. polymorphisms are interpreted as non-pathogenic because they do not lead to amino acid changes. These polymorphisms are not expected to have any. clinical significance. As 7% of patients who respond to EGFR inhibitors do not show mutations in exons 18-21 of EGFR gene, a negative result. does. preclude the possibility of a clinical response to EGFR inhibitors. KRAS Mutation Analysis. KRAS Mutation: NOT DETECTED. Based on sequence analysis, no mutations were detected in K-Ras exon 1 (codon 12 & 13) and exon 2 (codon 61). This result was reviewed and interpreted by. FISH, ALK, 2p23. FISH, ALK, 2P23: SEE BELOW. Specimen Type: Paraffin Embedded Tumor Tissue. Clinical Indication: FISH study for oncology. Method FISH. Total Cells : 100. Images Captured : 2. INTERPRETATION : FISH RESULT NEGATIVE FOR REARRANGEMENT OF ALK GENE, SUGGESTIVE OF GAIN OF ALK REGION. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, using break-apart probes specific for ALK gene (2p23; Abbott Molecular), did not exhibit a break-apart. pattern. Thus, this result is not indicative of a translocation involving the ALK gene. As an incidental finding, additional 1-6 copies of the ALK region were observed in 79% of cells. This suggests gain of the ALK region. The clinical. significance of this incidental finding is unknown. A small proportion of tumors (approximately 5%) with ALK rearrangement demonstrated by other methods may be missed by this study. This. does not rule out a malignancy or other genetic changes. This result should be considered in combination with other clinical and/or laboratory. data. The cutoff values for ALK rearrangement are 12% for paraffin-embedded specimens, 3% for bone marrow, 5% for peripheral blood. Please expect. the result of any other concurrent test in a separate report. This test was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by. not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. Laboratory results reviewed and Clinical Interpretation provided by. Mutational analysis of the EGFR and KRAS genes and ALK locus rearrangement by FISH were performed to survey the most common tumor-associated. genetic changes that have been shown to have prognostic and therapeutic consequences in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR. kinase. domain mutations are found in 10-15% of lung adenocarcinomas, particularly those occurring in younger patients without a smoking history,. and. identify tumors that may have significant clinical response to EGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors. Secondary somatic mutations in EGFR, particularly. T790M in exon 20, may accompany acquired resistance to these inhibitors. KRAS point mutations occur in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinomas and are largely mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations. KRAS mutations are. associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to anti-EGFR-directed immunotherapy. ALK locus rearrangement resulting in the EML4-ALK gene fusion is present in 3-5% of NSCLC, is most commonly seen in adenocarcinomas from. younger patients, and produces overexpression of the ALK tyrosine kinase. Patients who harbor ALK rearrangement do not benefit from EGFR tyrosine. kinase inhibitors and are recommended to be directed to trials of ALK-targeted agents. The. exons. tested. cumulatively comprise greater than 95% of the known activating mutations in the selected genes; rare mutations occurring at other sites. or in other genes that may influence outcome cannot be excluded. Genomic DNA was extracted from microdissected paraffin-embedded tissue sections isolated from the submitted block. PCR-based DNA sequencing. was. used to assess for mutations in exon 1 (including codon 12 & 13) and exon 2 (including codon 61) of KRAS and exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. (TK) domain. The sensitivity for mutation detection for these assays is approximately 10% mutant allele in the background of normal allele in the. microdissected area. The KRAS and EGFR test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by. Capistrano. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. The FISH test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by. It. has. not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. DIAGNOSIS. DIAGNOSIS: A.

PART 3: LUNG, LEFT UPPER DIVISION, SEGMENTECTOMY -. A. INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA WITH PAPILLARY DIFFERENTIATION (3.0. CM IN DIAMETER) ARISING IN A SCAR. NO EVIDENCE OF VISCERAL PLEURAL OR ANGIOLYMPHATIC. INVASION. MILD LYMPHOCYTIC HOST RESPONSE. PATHOLOGIC STAGE: T1N0MX. B. SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR. C. BACKGROUND LUNG WITH EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGE AND RESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLITIS. PART 4: LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 5, BIOPSY. ONE (1) LYMPH NODE WITH ANTHRACOTIC PIGMENT. ADDENDA: Addendum. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of. chromosome 7 of 1.0 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 7.1% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 1.6. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CASE SYNOPSIS: SYNOPTIC DATA - PRIMARY LUNG TUMORS. TUMOR LOCATION: Left Upper Lobe. LUNG SEGMENT(S) INVOLVED: Superior. PROCEDURE: Segmental.

Molecular Anatomic Pathology testing: A. KRAS Exon 1 mutation not identified. B. EGFR Exon 19 mutation IDENTIFIED (15 bp deletion). C. EGFR Exon 21 mutation not identified. Note: EGFR mutations are present in about 10% of. and up to 40% in the. population. EGFR mutations are not. thought to occur in high prevalence in other types of tumors (3,4,7). KRAS mutations are also found in approximately 30% lung. adenocarcinomas, but not in combination with EGFR mutations, which implies different pathogenic mechanisms (2,3). The. presence of these mutations may have prognostic and or therapeutic implications (1,5,6). Sample Preparation. For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgical specimens,. microdissection was performed to include neoplastic tissue and normal adjacent tissue. Optical density readings were obtained. Gene Sequencing. PCR was performed using primers that flank exon 1 in the KRAS gene and exon 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. Analysis of the. PCR products was first performed for the EGFR 19 to detect aberrant length PCR product. A sequencing analysis, using the. BigDye Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) was then performed. The known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of. mutations. Both forward and the reverse sequencing was performed.",0.92,0

Space-occupying lesion left lower lobe S6, (poorly differentiated large-cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma),. status post asbestos exposure. REPORT ON FINDINGS. Macroscopy. 1.) Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe of lung measuring 20 x 15 cm at the base and up to 17 cm in length,. central bronchus resection plane located 0.3 cm proximal to the bifurcation of B6. A 7 cm long branched staple suture. line runs in a ventrocaudal direction from the hilus. In the medioventral region over S6 a cusp-shaped part of the upper. lobe measuring 4 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm is attached, closed by a staple suture line. In the laterodorsal region over S6 and. adjacent sections of S10, part of the parietal pleura, measuring 9.5 x 5.5 cm, is mostly adhesive over an extensive area. and loosely attached in parts at the margin. At the hilus are 3 mobile grayish-black nodes between 0.2 and 0.7 cm in size. Ostium of B6 completely obstructed by endobronchial parts of a central, moderately solid, pale brownish, focally soft. tumor, max. 6 cm in size, located in S6, with unclear demarcation and extending right up to the ventral visceral pleura. over S6 and to within 0.2 cm of the hilar resection surface. Apparent central involvement of some grayish-black. parabronchial nodes up to 1.5 cm in size by the tumor.

Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Central to peripheral, histologically poorly differentiate, large-cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of. the lower lobe of the left lung located in S6. TNM classification according to this picture pT2 pN2 pMX R0, stage IIIA. C 34.3, M 8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Advanced, active, small foci of colliquating, chronic organizing and focal retention pneumonia accompanied by. fibrous remodeling of the parenchyma peripheral to the tumor associated with a pleural adhesion zone (sample. 1.)). Hilar lymph nodes of the main preparation and lymph nodes of samples 6.) and 7.) with uncharacteristic. reactive lesions, anthracotic pigment deposits and an old, nodular, cicatricially encapsulated area of necrosis. (sample 6.)). Remark/addendum: The tumor has obstructed B6 at its bifurcation, continuously infiltrated parabronchial lymph nodes and extended. focally to within at least 0.2 mm of the hilar resection surface. It has also grown across the pleural fissure. initially and into the co-resected tissue from the upper lobe and has formed further lymph node metastases in. samples 3.) - 5.).

AFS: Lung, left upper lobe, resection - Atypical glandular. liferation, suspicious but not diagnostic for malignancy. GROSS DESCRIPTION. Received is a container labeled with the patient's name,. medical record number and ""left upper lobe"". The specimen. consists of a single stapled wedge biopsy of lung measuring 9.5 X. 6.5 X 5 cm in greatest dimensions. The pleural surface is inked. and. the specimen is serially sectioned. On cut section there is a 3.2. X. 2.2 X 1.8 cm tan rubbery mass which is adjacent to the pleural. surface. This mass is greater than 0.6 cm from the nearest stapled. margin. RS-AFS1, A1-A9 representative sect S of the mass; A10. representative section of stapled margin. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. Sections of the left upper lobe demonstrate a markedly. atypical glandular proliferation. The slides were referred to the. The final report was. generated: ""The submitted slide. ft upper lobe reveal. atypical epithelioid cells characterized by ample cytoplasm and. irregular nuclei with prominent nucleoli.

TCGA-78-7158,"SEE SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT BELOW. HISTORY. LLL adenocarcinoma. MACROSCOPIC. Four specimens received: 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left lower lobe' and consists of a left lower lobe of lung measuring. 160 (SI) X 100 (AP) X 90 mm (ML). The pleural surface is puckered on the anteromedial aspect of the. superior portion of the lobe and underlying this there is a firm mass. This has been incised prior to. reception in the laboratory. Otherwise the pleural surface is unremarkable. There are two suture lines. extending from the hilum. One extends superiorly and measures 40 mm the other inferiorly and. measures 35 mm. Sectioning reveals a large poorly circumscribed tumour mass underlying the area of. pleural puckering described. Defining its dimensions macroscopically is difficult but it would be. approximately 70 (SI) X 60 (AP) X 70 mm (ML). It is made difficult as the tumour merges. imperceptibly with probable endogenous lipoid pneumonia in the surrounding parenchyma. The. tumour mass extends from the anterior pleural surface to the posterior pleural surface and extends to. within 10 mm of the bronchial resection margin. A discrete firm nodule is noted in the mid lateral. portion of the lobe which measures 5 X 5 X 5 mm. This appears to be separate from the main tumour. [1A, bronchial resection margin; 1B-1C peribronchial lymph nodes; 1D-1F tumour and relationship to. anterior pleural surface; 1G, probable tumour and superior aspect of lobe; 1H, tumour and posterior. aspect of lobe; 1I, inferior aspect of tumour; 1J, section including the firm small nodule described; 1K,. section of normal lung.] Specimen has been sampled for research. 2: The second specimen is labelled 'pulmonary vein' and consists of what appears to be a piece of. lymphoid tissue measuring 14 X 8 X 7 mm. Sectioning reveals only lymph node. [Bisected, BIT, 2A.]. 3: The third specimen is labelled ""No. 9 lymph node' and consists of a piece of nodal tissue measuring. 33 x 15 x 17 mm. [Trisected, BIT, 3A-3B.]. 4: The fourth specimen is labelled ""No. 10 lymph node' and consists of a single piece of nodal tissue. measuring 24 x 14 x 14 mm. [Bisected, BIT, 4A.]. MICROSCOPIC. 1. Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a papillary architecture. and includes areas with psammoma bodies and ""Orphan Annie' nuclei. There is a small component. with features of micropapillary differentiation. Although this may represent a lung primary, special. stains are being performed to exclude a thyroid or an ovarian primary. Surrounding the mass, there is a. patchy lepidic growth pattern and carcinoma is identified both within the airspaces and lymphatics in. the section from the normal lung. The nodule in the mid lateral portion of the lobe is a focus of tumour. with a surrounding lepidic growth pattern. The lesion is subpleural and the tumour invades into the. visceral pleural surface. There is possible focal surface involvement. Blood vessel and lymphatic. invasion is present. No perineural permeation is seen. Adenocarcinoma is present within all the. peribronchial lymph nodes including one at the bronchial resection margin. Extracapsular extension is. noted. Also present at the bronchial resection margin, there is lymphatic permeation within the. mucosa. No dysplasia is seen. There is insufficient normal lung parenchyma for assessment of. abnormalities. 2. Sections show a lymph node involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 3. Sections show lymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. 4. Sections show lymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma. SUMMARY. Left lower lobe and pulmonary vein, No. 9 and No. 10 lymph nodes: A: Moderately differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma; special stains being performed; at least 70 mm. in maximal dimension with extensive involvement of the surrounding lung including the section of. ""normal"" lung. B: Blood vessel and lymphatic invasion present but no perineural permeation is seen. C: Visceral pleural invasion identified; bronchial margin involved (mucosal lymphatic permeation). D: Lymph node metastases within all sampled nodes. E: T4N2MX. F: Non-neoplastic lung: Involved by carcinoma. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. The tumour cells are stains strongly for TTF 1 but are negative for thyroglobulin. Some patchy. positivity is identified with progesterone receptor markers but no convincing positivity is seen with the. oestrogen receptor markers. This immunohistochemical profile would support a diagnosis of primary. pulmonary adenocarcinoma. T-28000 M-81403 P1-03000.",0.15,0

Five specimens received: 1: The first specimen is labelled ""left upper lobe"" and consists of a lobe of lung measuring 155 x 95 x. 58 mm in the fresh state. Below the hilum there is a firm tumour which measures 68 x 65 mm in. maximal dimension and has a firm sclerotic cut surface. Towards the superior aspect of this there is a. firm node which is adherent to the medial aspect of the tumour. Further enlarged nodes are present. surrounding the inferior aspect of the bronchial resection margin and pulmonary artery. The tumour. abuts the pleural surface on this medial aspect but appears clear of the lateral aspect by approximately. 10 mm. On sectioning there are areas of necrosis and the tumour has a sclerotic cut face. Elsewhere. there is apical scarring.

[Blocked in toto, 5A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Patchy necrosis is present. Vascular invasion is present but the pulmonary artery is clear of malignancy. No pleural, lymphatic or. perineural invasion is identified. The bronchial resection margin is clear of malignancy and shows no. evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplasia. Obstructive pneumonitis is confirmed adjacent to the. tumour. Away from the tumour there are at least three further distinct lesions. The first is the nodule. noted in the lower zone which comprises granulomatous inflammation including numerous giant cells. of Langhans type with surrounding lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. A few tiny foci of necrosis. are present within this nodule. There are two further foci of granulomatous inflammation with. extensive central necrotic debris surrounded by foamy macrophages and fibrosis. These appear to be. centred on bronchi. No organisms are identified in any of these lesions with Grocott or ZN stains. However the appearances are highly suspicious for infection, and I note that atypical Mycobacteria. have been found previously in sputum. The peribronchial lymph nodes are confirmed to contain. metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and they also have foci of fibrosis and dystrophic calcification,. but they show no evidence of granulomatous inflammation. 2: Sections of the pulmonary artery show no evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph node show multiple silicotic nodules together with extensive sheets of. pigmented macrophages but there is no evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. 4: Sections show lymph nodes with a follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis and aggregates of. pigmented macrophages. There is no evidence of malignancy. 5: Sections show fragments of lymph node and surrounding fat. There is no evidence of metastatic. squamous cell carcinoma. SUMMARY. Left upper lobectomy and lymph node sampling: 1: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 68 mm in diameter. Vascular invasion present. No pleural, lymphatic or perineural infiltration seen,. Bronchial and pulmonary artery resection margins clear of malignancy. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in peribronchial lymph nodes. Pathological stage T2 N1. 2: Focally necrotising granulomatous inflammation consistent with atypical Mycobacterial infection. Dr. T-28000 M-80703 M-44700 P1-03000.",0.62,0

TCGA-05-4434,"Main diagnosis/diagnoses: Extensive and locoregionally advanced, central to peripheral, very likely primarily peripheral. bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung. with pleural invasion and metastatic dissemination to both pleural layers and lymph nodes. Tumor classification on the basis of this material pT4 pN1 pM1 (P/E) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.3. M 8255/3 G3. Comment/supplementary remark: Within the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the. parabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component,. which has a partly clear-cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main. tumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and. bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident. on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive. confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a. late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the. fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural. surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility. cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and. the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection preparation of parietal. pleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor-free. Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double. expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular. differentiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1. The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed. differentiation.",0.15,0

The specimen is labelled L wedge resection lingula' and consists of a wedge. resection of lung measuring in its partially Inflated state 115 x 90 x 35 mm. A staple line is present at the proximal margin measuring 85 mm in length. The. pleural surface contains two separate ragged/indurated areas. The largest. measures 35 x 25 mm and is roughened. The second smaller area measures 17 mm. in greatest dimension and has a punched out full thickness defect in the. pleura. The pleura surrounding these roughened areas shows diffuse thickening. The cut surface shows a pleural-based peripheral tumour. It has an ill-defined. outline with prominent adjacent collapse and consolidation. The tumour. measures approximately 35 x 31 x 19 mm. It appears to directly involve the two. disrupted pleural surfaces described previously. The tumour lles 15 mm from. the nearest surgical resection margin. The cut surface of the rest of the lung. parenchyma shows extensive obstructive changes. There are small firm nodules. within this ranging in size from 1 to 5 mm in greatest dimension. They may. represent separate tumour foci. There is also mild emphysema. [1A-1B, tumour. including resection margin; 1C-1D, RS tumour adjacent to smaller full thickness. pleural defect; 1E, RS tumour adjacent to intact pleura next to small defect;. 1F, RS tumour adjacent to larger full thickness pleural defect; 1G, RS possible. separate tumour foci within consolidation; 1H, RS relatively normal lung.]. MICROSCOPIC. Sections show a moderately differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma. It shows areas of necrosis and is associated with a florid Inflammatory. response. Invasion of the visceral pleura is confirmed and carcinoma is. present on the inked surface of the disrupted pleura. The stapled surgical. resection margin is well clear of malignancy. Tumour surrounds and compresses. a number of blood vessels, and there is focal vascular invasion. No lymphatic. or perineural invasion is identified. The surrounding lung is confirmed to. show organising obstructive pneumonitis. The nodules noted macroscopically. appear to represent foci of bronchiectasis, organising pneumonia and localised. subpleural honeycomb change. No tumour is identified within these areas. There is interstitial fibrosis in these areas and there are a few foci of. fibroblastic proliferation reminiscent of the fibroblastic foci of UIP; however. the section of normal appearing lung shows only emphysema with no features to. suggest an established interstitial pneumonitis. No lymph nodes are included. SUMMARY. Lingulectomy: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 35 mm in diameter. Pleural invasion present with disruption and tumour on pleural surface. Vascular invasion present. No lymphatic or perineural invasion identified. No lymph nodes included. Pathological stage T2a Nx. Repc. T-28000 M-80703 P1-03000. ANATOMICAL PATHOLOGY.",0.62,0

Submitted fresh for frozen section labeled ""left upper. lobe"" is an intact lobe of lung tissue measuring 17 X 16 X. 6-8 cm. in thickness. It has been amputated at the level of its. main bronchi which are grossly unremarkable. Several anthracotic. lymph nodes are present around that margin as well as lines of. staples. There are several blebs of tissue present along one. pleural surface as well as a firm nodule on the pleura measuring 1. cm. in size approximately 5 cm. from the bronchial stump. Serial. sections are then placed in the lobe and this reveals the presence. of a second mass, this is a spiculated tumor nodule which measures. maximally 2.5 cm. across, it has a granular tan and black cut. surface with anthracotic pigment within it. It is puckered and. folds the surrounding red brown lung parenchyma towards it. It is. below the pleural surface by approximately 1 cm. Representative. portion of that tumor nodule is submitted for frozen section and. tissue procurement as per request of. Sections through. the remainder of the lung revealed no additional nodules other than. the two mentioned. Sections after fixation. B. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled.

TCGA-66-2727,"Material examined: Left lower lobe and others. Clinical diagnosis and question. Left lower lobe bronchial carcinoma, suspected hepatic metastases (not confirmed). REPORT ON FINDINGS. Macroscopy. 1) Left upper lobe: inflated, fixed preparation measuring 13 x 7 cm at the base and up to 18 cm in length. Pleura cloudy, lateral and dorsal adhesion residues and on the base, ventrobasal edge turned in a dorsal. direction. Whitish yellow discoloration of the pleura in a laterobasal area up to 5 cm in size, with relatively. clear demarcation at the edges. Bronchus displaced in the region of the B6/basal group branching, adjacent to. two partially lesioned grayish black nodes up to 1.8 cm and on the ventral side to a parenchymal flap enclosed. by a line of metal staple sutures 6 X 4 X 2 cm in size, apparently belonging to the lower lobe. Marker threads. inserted in the middle of the central area of the row of clips there. Discontinuation of B8 and 9 in a nodular. tumor with a largest extent of 4.2 cm extending from the central region to the periphery, with rather imprecise. borders and with a markedly arched edge in places. Pale grey, vitreous tumor tissue, slate grey pigmentation. towards the center, also irregularly circumscribed, eccentric cavity 8 mm in size. Extension of the tumor. towards the pleura in the area of the point of contact with the parenchymal flap described. As far as could be. detected no infiltration of the adjacent parenchymal flap. By the stretches of the root of 88 and 9 also large. vascular branches let into the tumor and apparently destroyed in places. Slight twisting of the stretches of the. root located in the tumor region of B10, this was otherwise clear as far as the periphery, like B6. Sections of B8. and 9 located peripherally of the tumor moderately widened, however, with whitish yellow material in the. lumens in places. Pulmonary tissue densities, especially laterally in the tumor border area, with speckled,. grayish brown section surfaces. A wedge-shaped area of induration of about the same size beneath the. laterobasal pleural changes described. Normal parenchyma in segments 6 and 10. 2) S2 left upper lobe wedge: fragment of pulmonary tissue in filled, fixed condition, 1,9 x 1.5 cm at the base. and up to 6 mm high, with hazy, cloudy pleura, eccentric pleura and parenchyma already incised, inclusion of. pale grey area of induration about 1 cm in size extending as far as the base of the preparation with imprecise. edges, in places more palpable than visible. 3) S1 left upper lobe wedge: already previously fixed, pale reddish tissue fragment 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm in size. after an attempt at filling. 4) Lobar LN (item 12) left upper lobe: fragment of 1.1 cm with black-black pigment. 5) Hilar LN (item 10) left: two nodes of 1.3 and 1.9 cm with blackish pigment in places. 6) Pulmonary ligament lymph node (item 9) left: reddish fragment of 0.5 cm. 7) Paraesophageal LN (item 8) left: node 1.7 cm in size with a little black red pigment. 8) Subaortic LN (aortopulmonary window) (item 5): dark black red node, 0.9 cm in size, with pigment in places. 9) Subcarinal LN (item 7): black red node or partial node 1.3 cm in size, pigmented in places. Examined. 1) Rapid section residue (resection surface adjacent to parenchymal flap beneath the area of the staple suture. line tangentially marked with thread), 3 other section of peripheral tumor with adjacent parenchymal flap. (resection surface beneath the row of staple suture at this place marked in green, the point of removal of the. rapid section sample marked in red), central tumor with stretch of root of B9 and central vascular branches of. the basal group, 1 section each of periphery of the parenchymal tumor and the laterobasal induration area,. central bronchial resection line and vascular displacement borders, nodes by the bronchial stump,. 2) Laminated preparation,. 3) - 9) Total material,. 16 blocks, Elastic-van Gieson, PAS, diastase-PAS, iron. Microscopy. Description of the histological and cytological findings omitted for reasons of capacity. EVALUATION. Bronchopulmonary carcinoma of the left lower pulmonary lobe extending from the center to the periphery,. the center probably primary, histologically poorly or largely undifferentiated, large cell squamous cell. epithelial carcinoma with keratinization. Tumor manifestation in segments 8 and 9, where there was. surrounding and compression of the large pulmonary veins and incursion into and displacement of a branch of. the pulmonary artery. Peripheral incursion of the carcinoma into the pleura of the inter-lobar cleft and. minimal continuous progression into the jointly resected flap of pulmonary tissue from the upper lobe. (clinically: lingula), where the removal point was free of tumor. Large area of parenchymal necrosis in the. parts of the lower lobe behind that point in the nature of an infarction as a consequence of the disruption to. blood flow caused by the tumor with massive accumulation of siderophages in the border region and. accompanying fibrinous pleurisy that had already been smoldering for some time. Bronchus and vascular. displacement borders free of tumor, also the altogether rather slight deposition of anthracotic pigment. removed and lymph nodes showing reactive changes. No lymph nodes in sample 6), here pleural and. mediastinal tissue with soft adhesive strands and chronic inflammation. In the small fragment of pulmonary. tissue recorded under 3) a circumscribed focus of interstitial fibrosis or scarring with development of smooth. muscle. In sample 2) a rather larger, striated or wedge-shaped parenchymal scar of the pulmonary. parenchyma with atypical bronchiolo-alveolar or adenomatous cell proliferation at the edge.

TCGA-78-7167,"HISTORY. Pneumonectomy. Left pneumonectomy. Left lung cancer. Left lower lobe crossing fissure into lingula. MACROSCOPIC. Four specimens received. The specimen is labelled ""left lung"" and comprises a left lung, 240 X 170 x 40 mm in the fresh state. A. 30 mm length of bronchus protrudes from the hilum. There is an area of induration and puckering on. the lateral aspect of the pleura of the lower lobe. There is also an area of induration and puckering in. the interlobar fissure. A further area of induration is present posterolaterally on the upper lobe. A. number of emphysematous bullae are present at the apex and in the anterior margin of the upper lobe. Serial parallel slicing through the lung parenchyma reveals a tumour mass approximately 65 mm in. greatest diameter abutting the pleura of the lateral aspect of the lower lobe. This tumour has a fleshy,. grey, somewhat mucoid, cut surface. Posteriorly it merges with adjacent lung parenchyma and its full. extent is difficult to appreciate macroscopically. At its upper aspect, in the region of previously noted. puckering in the interlobar fissure, tumour appears to cross into the upper lobe. There is extensive. greyish-white consolidation extending from this point anteriorly into the lingula. It is unclear whether. this represents tumour or infective consolidation. Beneath the area of puckering noted on the postero-. lateral aspect of the upper lobe, there is a separate area of parenchymal consolidation and possible. fibrosis. The remainder of the upper lobe parenchyma appears emphysematous. In the lower segments. of the lower lobe there is no evidence of emphysema and there is very little anthracosis. However, on. the medial aspect, towards the diaphragmatic surface of the lung, there is an area of plaque-like pleural. thickening approximately 10 mm in diameter and 2-3 mm in depth. [1A, bronchial resection margin. and peribronchial lymph nodes; 1B, peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1E, tumour and overlying lateral. pleura; 1F, tumour within interlobar fissure; 1G, lingular consolidation; 1H, subpleural consolidation. and fibrosis in posterolateral aspect of upper lobe; 1I, representative upper lobe parenchyma; 1J,. plaque like nleural Lesion from medial aspect of lower lobe]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""aortopulmonary window"" and consists of three irregular reddish-brown. pieces of fatty tissue which measure in aggregate 10 X 10 X 2 mm. [BIT, 2A]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""inferior pulmonary ligament"" and consists of an ovoid-shaped piece of. greyish-black tissue, 12 X 7 X 5 mm, which has a smooth outer surface and is covered in a small. amount of fat. [Bisected and BIT, 3A]. 4: The specimen is labelled ""lymph node"" and consists of two irregular nodular pieces of tissue which. have a slate-grey appearance. The larger piece measures 18 X 5 x 4 mm and the smaller piece measures. 15x4x2 mm [Each portion of tissue is BIT, 4A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show that the majority of the tumour comprises well-differentiated papillary. adenocarcinoma. Focally there is stromal invasion by moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a. more usual acinar architecture, Tumour abuts but does not invade the lateral pleura. However, at its. superior aspect it does cross the interlobar fissure into the upper lobe (1F), and there is extensive. contiguous infiltration of the lingula (1G). The abnormal area in the posterolateral aspect of the upper. lobe (1H) is an entirely separate deposit of histologically identical papillary adenocarcinoma with. adjacent fibroelastotic scarring and emphysema. This presumably represents a metastasis, although a. synchronous primary tumour cannot be excluded. Definite vascular or lymphatic invasion is not. identified in any of the sections, and none of the peribronchial lymph nodes contains metastatic. adenocarcinoma. The plaque-like pleural lesion on the medial aspect of the lower lobe appears to. represent artefactual diathermy injury. 2-4: Sections of each of the separately submitted lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic. adenocarcinoma. SUMMARY. Left pneumonectomy: Papillary adenocarcinoma of left lower lobe, 65 mm in diameter, crossing interlobar fissure into left. upper lobe. Separate focus of adenocarcinoma in left upper lobe.

Four specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""left lower lobe"" and consists of a left lower lobe which measures. approximately 120 X 130 x 100 mm in maximum dimension. On palpation of the lower zone of the. lobe there is a firm to hard mass which has caused some puckering of the pleural surface of the base of. the lobe. The pleural surface surrounding the rest of this firm to hard area has a pale brown, slightly. nodular, appearance compared to the normal appearing pleura. On sectioning there is a well-defined. greyish-brown solid mass which has a mucoid cut surface. It measures 75 x 60 mm in maximum. dimension. The tumour appears well clear of the bronchial resection margin by at least 40 mm. Distant lung parenchyma has a collapsed mottled pinkish-grey appearance. [1A, bronchial resection. margin; 1B, hilar lymph nodes; 1C-F, tumour with nearest pleural surface; 1G-H, tumour with pleural. puckering 11, distant uninvolved lung parenchyma]. 2: The specimen is labelled with patient's details only and consists of an irregular portion of lung, 33 x. 25 x 22 mm, bearing a stapled margin, 30 mm in length. The remainder of the specimen is largely. covered by pleura, but on the opposite side to the stapled margin, there is a ""bare area"" approximately. 30 X 15 mm. The stapled resection margin has been removed and the bare areas inked. Serial parallel. slicing reveals lung parenchyma in which there is evidence of emphysema but no mass lesions are. identified and there is no definite evidence of fibrosis. [3 representative TS, 2A-B]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""lingular node"" and consists of three fragments of firm cream and grey. tissue ranging from 4-11 mm in greatest diameter. [Wrapped and blocked in toto, 3A]. 4: The specimen is labelled ""No. 11 lymph node"" and consists of three portions of firm grey and cream. tissue ranging from 2 mm in diameter to 15 x 10 x 5 mm. [The largest specimen is bisected. longitudinally and all tissue wrapped and BIT, 4A]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show a well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. The lesion is subpleural but definite. pleural invasion is not identified. Special stains are being performed to confirm this. There is no blood. vessel invasion and no lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The. lesion is clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is squamous metaplasia and severe dysplasia. at. the resection margin. Hilar lymph node metastases of adenocarcinoma are seen. The lung away. from the tumour shows evidence of centriacinar emphysema. 2: Sections show marked centriacinar emphysema. Around some bronchovascular bundles, there is a. mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate including lymphoid follicles. There is no evidence of. squamous metaplasia, dysplasia or malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph node show scattered deposits of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma. 4: Sections of the lymph node show scattered deposits of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma. SUMMARY. Left lower lobe lung and lymph nodes: 1: Well differentiated adenocarcinoma; 75 mm in maximal dimension. 2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion seen. 3: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin. 4: Hilar, lingular and No 11 lymph node metastases,. 5: T2N1MX. 6: Squamous metaplasia and severe dysplasia at bronchial resection margin. 7: No involvement of separate piece of lung; centriacinar emphysema present.

TCGA-77-8133,"Histopathology Report. RIGHT MIDDLE AND LOWER LOBES, NO. 7 NODE. Clinical Notes: Ca RLL. Two specimens submitted: 1: RIGHT MIDDLE AND LOWER LOBES. Macroscopy: The specimen is labelled ""right middle and lower lobes (lung)"" and consists of. the right lower lobe and a portion of the right middle lobe. The specimen. measures 110 mm medial to lateral X 120 mm superior to inferior X up to 120 mm. anterior to posterior. Approximately 20 mm of middle lobe is present superior. to the lower lobe and the interlobar fissure appears obliterated by adhesions. The main bronchus bifurcates 20 mm from the resection margin. The first branch. runs horizontally towards the lateral surface and the second branch runs. inferiorly. Immediately after the bifurcation the first horizontal bronchus is. intimately involved with a large tumour mass. This tumour mass extends for 30. mm along the bronchus. Distal to this there is a large region of presumed. carnification. This area involves the posterior basal and lateral basal. segments and the apical segment. [Sections taken: BRM, 1A; two complete. sections through bronchial tumour, 1B-1C; section of RML resection margin to. include some carnification, 1D; section of lateral pleura with carnified lung,. 1E; section of basal pleura with carnified lung, 1F; sections of hilar lymph. nodes, 1G.]. Microscopy: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion is. arising from a bronchus. In this region the bronchus shows squamous metaplasia. with varying grades of dysplasia. Pleural invasion is not identified but. tumour extends into hilar fat adjacent to the pulmonary artery. There is no. blood vessel invasion but perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is. well clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is tumour present in. soft tissue adjacent to the pulmonary artery margin. Peribronchial lymph node. metastases are seen and there is tumour within an extracapsular lymphatic. supplying the node. The carnified distal lung shows prominent organising. pneumonia with an associated granulomatous reaction. 2: LYMPH NODE NO. 7. Macroscopy: The specimen is labelled ""No. 7"" and consists of a piece of tissue measuring 40. X 25 x 15 mm. On sectioning, this tissue is consistent with lymph node with. marked anthracosis. [Complete section through the node taken, 1A-1B.] No. focal lesions are identified. Page 1 of. Histopathology Report. Microscopy: Sections of the lymph node show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of. malignancy. Summary: Right middle and lower lobes and lymph nodes: 1: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 30 mm in maximal dimension. 2: Perineural and lymphatic permeation identified; no blood vessel invasion. present. 3: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin but present. adjacent to pulmonary artery margin. 4: Peribronchial lymph node metastases. 5: T1N1MX.

COMMENT: Within the submitted tissue, there is a 3.9 cm, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which in part is of clear-cell. type. Based on the solitary nature of the neoplasm, we favor it being a primary lung tumor, however,. immunohistochemical stains are being performed to rule out the possibility of metastatic disease. In total, seven lymph. nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma, six of these being from the hilus and one being a tracheal-bronchial lymph. node. Since we are unsure what level the tracheal-bronchial lymph comes from, the pathologic stage is T2, N1, MX. Results of immunohistochemical stains will be reported in a separate addendum.

TCGA-77-A5G7,"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. No clinical notes supplied. MACROSCOPIC. One specimen submitted. The specimen is labelled `left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung. measuring 230 x 100 x 20 mm in the uninflated state. A number of bullous. structures are present at the apex of the lobe over an area 40 x 20 mm. There. is a small area of fibrous pleural thickening on the lateral aspect of the lobe. over an area approximately 20 x 20 mm. Beneath this area of thickening is a. palpable tumour mass. The pleura moves over this mass and does not appear to. be involved. At the hilum there are two bronchial profiles, 10 and 8 mm in. diameter. Very few peribronchial nodes are included. A stapled resection. line, 70mm in length, extends posteroinferiorly from the hilum. Transverse. slicing reveals an extensively necrotic tumour mass 25 x 25 x 20 mm, lateral to. the. hilum and approaching the lateral pleural surface. The cut surface of this. tumour has a variegated grey and yellow appearance. Adjacent to the tumour is. an ill defined area of yellowish discolouration of lung parenchyma measuring. approximately 10 mm in maximum dimension. There is also an ill-defined area of. parenchymal fibrosis adjacent to the tumour. Elsewhere the lung parenchyma. shows severe emphysematous changes. [1A, bronchial resection margin; 1B,. peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-1E tumour with overlying pleura; 1F, area of. yellowish discolouration; 1G, ill-defined fibrous scar adjacent to tumour; 1H,. apical bulla; 1I, uninvolved lung parenchyma superior to tumour; 1J, involved. lung parenchyma inferior to tumour.]. MICROSCOPY. Sections show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measuring 25mm. in maximum dimension. There is extensive tumour necrosis with associated foamy. macrophages and cholesterol clefts. The periphery of the carcinoma has a. growth pattern filling air spaces. Extensive vascular invasion is present at. the periphery of the carcinoma together with focal perivascular lymphatic space. invasion, There is mild fibro-elastotic scarring of the visceral pleura. adjacent to the tumour but no evidence of pleural invasion by the carcinoma. The carcinoma is clear of the bronchial resection margin which shows focal. squamous metaplasia and mild squamous dysplasia. The area of yellow. discoloration adjacent to the carcinoma shows focal collapse, interstitial. fibrosis and localised obstructive changes including dilated air spaces. containing numerous macrophages and proteinaceous fluid. Within this region. there is a mildly dilated bronchiole showing focal moderate squamous dysplasia. There is also an area of dense fibrous scarring adjacent to the carcinoma. The. non-neoplastic lung shows scattered mixed dust macules and aggregates of. pigmented airspace macrophages. Apical bullous emphysema is present and this is. associated with subpleural fibrosis and prominent chronic inflammation together. with focal fibrous obliteration of the pleural space and a small amount of. 1 agezo. adherent chest wall fat. The peribronchial lymph nodes show sinus. histiocytosis and mild carbon pigment deposition but no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY.

Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13. of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under. the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. (CLIA) as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Testing performed at. EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION:",0.78,0
