"HISTORY. Histopathology of right upper lobe and chest wall resection for cancer. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper. lobe with attached chest wall. The right upper lobe measures 140 x 100 x 79 mm. in maximum dimension. The chest wall component consists of four ribs and. measures 140 X 60 mm in maximum dimension. On the hilar surface there are two. vertical soft tissue excision margins which are closed with staples, the. longest of which measures 90 mm and the other measures 60 mm. The staples are. removed and the new resection margin is inked in blue. On sectioning the. specimen there is a large cavitating mass which has an ill-defined lobulated. appearance and measures, in maximum dimension, 58 X 55 mm. The tumour appears. to lie approximately 13 mm from the bronchial resection margin. The tumour. lies well clear of the longest soft tissue excision margin and approximately 8. mm from the shorter soft tissue excision margin. The chest wall is blunt. A. dissected off the main specimen. The tumour does not appear macroscopically to. have infiltrated the chest wall as there is a thickened greyish-white soft. N. fibrous-like capsule between the tumour and the chest wall. The tumour focally. A. appears to be very close to the serosal surface. The small amount of normal. lung parenchyma that is present appears unremarkable. [1A, bronchial resection.

Please note the chest wall is submitted for decalcification and a further. 1. report will be issued upon examination of the ribs histologically. C. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of three irregular. A. greyish-brown pieces of tissue measuring in aggregate 20 X 10 X 7 mm. [The. largest is bisected and BIT with the other pieces, 2A]. L. 3: The specimen is labelled ""peri-oesophageal lymph node"" and consists of an. irregular piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 15 X 7 X 4 mm. [Bisected and. P. BIT, 3A]. A. T. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a cavitated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Also. H. focally lining the cavity is a small amount of atypical squamous epithelium but. a significant malignant squamous component is not identified within the. o. carcinoma. The lesion is invading through visceral pleural to involve chest. wall fibrous connective tissue. There is blood vessel invasion but no. L. lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The. a. lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin. No lymph node. metastases are seen. Surrounding the tumour there is evidence of obstructive. pneumonitis. The adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. 3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no. evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Right upper lobe lung and lymph nodes: 1: Cavitated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; 58 mm in maximal dimension. 2: Blood vessel permeation identified but no lymphatic or perineural invasion. present. 3: Visceral pleural invasion with chest wall involvement identified; clear of. bronchial margin. 4: No lymph node metastases.

These are sections of lymph node characterized by. moderate sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no evidence of. involvement by tumor. C. Eight slides are examined. Sections of lung include residual tumor. (slides 5 and 6 ), composed of abnormal glands. There is surrounding. pneumonitis with aggregated foamy histiocytes present within alveoli,. associated with interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells, including. lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Sections of the second-described. mass (block C3) reveal a circumscribed, but non-encapsulated, nodular mass,. composed of a monotonous population of cells having ovoid to spindle-shaped. nuclei, arranged in a nested/organoid pattern. The cells have bland chromatin. with inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are not readily identified. The. grossly-described bullous area is characterized by irregular disruption of the. subpleural alveolar architecture, associated with irregular fibrous thickening. of the pleura, which is infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells, including. lymphocytes and plasma cells, forming occasional loose aggregates. Clusters. of pigmented histiocytes are present within the dilated alveolar spaces. Random sections of lung reveal mild patchy dilation of alveoli, most notably. within the peripheral portions of the parenchyma. No other tumor is. identified. Sections of the bronchial margin are lined by ciliated,. pseudostratified columnar epithelium with areas of squamous metaplasia. The. vascular margin of resection is uninvolved by tumor. A peribronchial lymph. node is characterized by sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no. morphologic evidence of involvement by tumor. D.

"HISTORY. Lung cancer. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens received: 1: The specimen is labelled 'left upper lobe' and comprises a lobe of lung measuring 230 x 140 x 35. mm after formalin inflation. There is an area of roughening of the pleural surface on the medial aspect. of the lobe anterior to the hilum measuring 40 mm in diameter. Several bullae are present at the apex. where there is again some irregular pleural thickening and roughening. No obvious tumour is apparent. on the pleural surface. Serial transverse slicing reveals an irregular pale tumour mass, 37 mm in. greatest diameter, occupying the central portion of the superior part of the lobe. Tumour is at least 25. mm deep to the closest pleural surface. It is also at least 30 mm from the bronchial resection margin. Uninvolved lung parenchyma shows moderately severe emphysema. No satellite lesions are identified. [1A, peribronchial lymph node; 1B, bronchial resection margin; 1C-D, complete TS of tumour. bisected; 1E, uninvolved parenchyma from apex; 1F, uninvolved parenchyma from lingula]. 2: The specimen is labelled 'lymph node upper lobe' and comprises an irregular portion of fatty and. issue measuring 17 x 12 x 4 mm. [BIT after bisection, 2A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1. Sections show a very poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Tumour is growing as large. nests and sheets of cells with central necrosis. Very focal but convincing keratinization is taking place. The lesion is located halfway between the pleura and the hilum and pleural invasion is not identified. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is. identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin. Peribronchial lymph nodes are. showing sinus histiocytosis and contain some carbon pigment but metastases are absent. The adjacent. lung shows prominent emphysema. 2.

"Histopathology Report. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT BELOW (22/2). HISTORY. LU lobectomy. Past history Hutchinson's melanotic freckle. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled left upper lobe' and consists of a lobectomy. specimen measuring in its partially inflated state 210 x 150 x 50 mm. Two. separate bronchi are seen at the hilum ranging in size from 10 to 12 mm in. diameter (lying approximately 30 mm apart). Surrounding the two bronchi is a. bare area measuring 55 mm in maximal diameter. A staple line is seen radiating. from the hilar to the periphery, it measures 80 mm in length. Differential. inking is as follows, the bare area is inked black and the staple line is. removed and inked blue. The pleural surface is tan to grey with a diffuse area. of induration over the lateral lower aspect of the lobe extending over the. lingular, which measures 60 mm in greatest dimension. There is also scarring. over the apex measuring 15 mm in greatest dimension. The cut surface of the. lung shows a centrally based/peri-bronchial tumour measuring 35 mm in greatest. dimension. It extends peripherally to focally abut the pleural surface. (posterior lateral). Definite macroscopic invasion of the pleura is not seen. The tumour has a white firm cut surface with focal areas of necrosis. It lles. 10 mm from the closest bronchial margin. A second firm tan nodule measuring 6. mm in greatest dimension in the apical portion of the lobe. It lies 2 mm from. the pleural surface (appears to abut the pleural surface) and over 70 mm to the. bronchial margin and 65 mm from the main tumour mass. There is normal. intervening lung. The residual lung shows moderate to severe emphysema and an. area of pleurally based fibrosis adjacent to the induration over the. lingular/lateral surface. [1A, bronchial margin; 1B, hilar lymph nodes; 1C-D,. TS through tumour with 1C including closest bronchial margin and 1D showing. extension to pleura; 1E-F, RS of tumour abutting pleural surface; 1G, second. possible tumour within apical aspect of lobe; 1H, RS of normal intervening lung. between main tumour mass and smaller tumour; 11, peri-bronchial lymph nodes;. 1J, area of fibrosis over lateral/lingular pleura; 1K, RS of emphysema within. upper portion of lobe]. 2: The specimen is labelled hilar lymph node left lung' and consists of over. ten fragments of what appears to be nodal tissue ranging in size from 2 mm to. the largest piece measuring 20 mm in greatest dimension. The fragments have. a. grey black cut surface. [BIT: 2A, largest plece bisected; 2B, multiple smaller. fragments]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections reveal a moderate and poorly differentiated squamous cell. carcinoma. The tumour abuts but does not invade visceral pleura. The tumour. is clear of the bronchial resection margin. Within the confines of the tumour. there is focal vascular and lymphatic invasion. No perineural permeation by. tumour is seen. Peribronchial lymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus. histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent. material in keeping with silicate. No tumour is identified within these nodes. Immediately adjacent to the tumour there is focal change within lung parenchyma. in keeping with obstructive pneumonitis characterised by focal organising. pneumonia, mild acute alveolitis, and a few collections of intra-alveolar foamy. macrophages. Marked emphysema is present. Associated with a mixed dust macule. there is a small non-necrotising granuloma. The separately described. macroscopic lesions represent foci of scarring and organising pneumonia. No. tumour is identified within these areas. 2: Sections of lymph node tissue reveal reactive changes with prominent sinus. histiocytosis, carbon pigment deposition and scattered flecks of birefringent. material in keeping with silicate. Reactive follicular hyperplasia is also. noted. Rare tiny ill-defined non-necrotising granulomata are also seen. focally. There is no evidence of malignancy.

"HISTORY. RLL. ? Soft tissue bronchial margin. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right lower lobe"" and consists of a lobectomy specimen which measures. 135 mm from superior to inferior, 150 mm at the base from anterior to posterior and up to 55 mm from. lateral to medial. The pleural surface is smooth. There is a stapled resection margin superior to the. hilum. A firm nodule is palpable inferior to the hilum. Adjacent to the bronchial resection margin. there is a firm nodule which is relatively circumscribed. It measures approximately 18 mm in diameter. and on sectioning appears to represent an involved lymph node with an adjacent compressed bronchial. branch. Sectioning of the lung parenchyma reveals a large tumour mass which extends from the hilum. towards the periphery. The nodule is irregular in shape. It has a cream and grey cut surface. It. measures 55 x 50 X 35 mm and lies approximately 15 mm from the overlying diaphragmatic pleural. surface, but extends to within 3mm of the lateral pleura. Towards the hilum there is a second. circumscribed nodule which lies immediately adjacent to the main tumour mass. This nodule measures. 15 mm in diameter and may possibly represent an involved lymph node. A further suspicious lymph. node is identified within the lung parenchyma superior to the main bronchus and this measures 10 mm. in maximum dimension. There are no other focal lesions. [1A-bronchial and vascular resection. margins; 1B-peribronchial lymph nodes; 1C-large peribronchial nodule close to margin; 1D-suspicious. nodule on superior aspect of main bronchus; 1E-RS of tumour; 1F-1G tumour with overlying nearest. pleural margins; 1H-nodule adjacent to main tumour; 1I-uninvolved lung.]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""middle lobe lymphatic tissue"" and consists of a single fragment of cream. tissue which is elongated. It measures 15 x 2 x 2 mm. [BIT-2A.]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""No. 7 lymph node"" and consists of multiple fragments of black and grey. fibrofatty tissue having an aggregate measurement of 40 x 25 x up to 8 mm. Sectioning reveals. blackened lymph nodes. [The largest fragment is bisected and one half is blocked with all remaining. fragments in 3A-3B.1. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion is in the region of the. central bronchi and extends out towards the pleura. Pleural invasion is not identified. There is no. blood vessel invasion but lymphatic permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The. lesion is clear of the bronchial resection margin but there is a nodule of tumour within the adjacent soft. tissue. This is partly related to a lymph node and extends close to/if not at the inked resection margin. Further levels are being examined. Several peribronchial lymph node metastases are seen. There is. organising pneumonia surrounding the tumour and the adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. The bronchial resection margin shows squamous metaplasia with mild dysplasia. 2: Sections show an artery with surrounding fibroadipose tissue and nerves. There is no involvement. by tumour. 3: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Right lower lobe lung and lymph nodes: 1: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 55 mm in maximal dimension. 2: Lymphatic permeation identified but no blood vessel or perineural invasion present. 3: No pleural invasion identified and clear of bronchial margin; soft tissue extension partly related to. a. lymph node that extends close to/if not at the hilar resection margin. 4: Peribronchial lymph node metastases. 5: T3N1MX. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. Deeper sections of the large peribronchial nodule close to the mediastinal margin have been examined. Carcinoma extends extremely closely to this margin.
