"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. Mass removed (lobectomy). ?Malignant. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled 'right upper lobe plus ribs' and consists of a. right upper lobe measuring 180 x 105 x 45 mm. There is a vertical stapled line. rsuperior to the hilum measuring 80 mm in length. Over the apex there are two. attached short segments of ribs. Rib 1 is relatively closely adhered over the. pleural surface and measures 55 x 30 x 28 mm. This rib is cut towards one end,. 22 mm from the true resection margin. Rib 2 loosely hangs from a fibrous. fragment and measures 55 x 28 x 18 mm. Over the posterolateral aspect of the. lung is a small segment of adherent parietal pleura measuring 30 x 25 mm. Within the apex, underlying the ribs is a firm white lesion measuring 25 x 25 x. 23 mm. The mass shows focal central necrosis. The tumour is well clear of the. hilar resection margin. The apical rib is removed and the underlying pleural. surface is inked black. The true pleural margin is inked blue. The tumour. appears to invade the pleura within this region, but does not extend into the. overlying soft tissue. The remainder of the lung parenchyma shows severe. emphysema with bullae in the apical aspect surrounding the tumour. No other. focal lesions are seen or felt throughout the lobe.

[BIT: 2A]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""fourth rib right' and consists of a rib fragment. with attached soft tissue. The rib measures 12 x 17 x 7 mm. The attached soft. tissue measuring 17 x 10 x 10 mm. No obvious lesion is identified within the. specimen. [3A, soft tissue BIT; 3B, rib]. Please note that sections from the ribs in specimen 1 and 3 to follow. MICROSCOPIC. 1. Sections show a peripheral moderatery-differentiated squamous cell. carcinoma. There is pronounced desmoplasia and a central area of necrosis in. association with the tumour. There is obliteration of the pleural space. overlying the tumour due to adhesions and desmoplasia. It is difficult to. interpret the layers but there is clear invasion through pleura and into chest. wall. The involved fat appears to represent lipomatous metaplasia of pleura. Printed : Histopathology Report. rather than chest wall fat. Tumour does not extend as far as the muscle or. bone and therefore the chest wall margin appears clear. The bronchial. resection margin shows no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy. No. lymphatic, vascular or perineural invasion is seen. The sampled lymph nodes. show sinus histiocytosis with moderate amounts of carbon pigment and no. evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The surrounding lung parenchyma shows focal. lipoid pneumonia and emphysema. Collections of smokers macrophages are. present. COMMENT. No sections of the ribs have been examined at this stage as the tissue is still. being decalcified. Sections of the ribs will be examined in due course and a. final report issued. 2. Sections of lymph node show sinus histiocytosis and a moderate amount. of. carbon pigment deposition and silicate crystals. There is no evidence of. metastatic carcinoma. 3. Sections show normal intercostal muscle and adipose tissue. There is no. evidence of invasive or metastatic carcinoma. INTERIM SUMMARY. 1 - 3. Right upper lobe of lung, ribs and No10 lymph node: 1: Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 30 mm in maximal. dimension. 2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present. 3: Invasion into chest wall; clear of margins. 4: No lymph node metastases. 5: Pathological stage pT3NOMx. 6: Rib sections still pending decalcification. T-28000 M-80703 P1-03000. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT -. The sections of rib have now been examined and these do not show any. pathological features. FINAL SUMMARY. 1 - 3.

"Histopathology Report. HISTORY. NSCLC (close to main bronchus). Left pneumonectomy. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens received: 1: pneumonectomy including upper and lower lobes measuring 265 mm SI x 170 This mm AP x. The specimen is labelled 'left lung' and consists of a left sided. ML. The left main bronchus extends 22 mm from the hilar margin. 20 mm. 48 bronchus mm is macroscopically uninvolved by tumour for at least the first which. Sectioning through the specimen reveals a 42 mm white spiculated mass to. arises distal to the bifurcation of the left main bronchus.
